<p class="pbq p1">The Gallop-change from Right to Left. The horse, having
been in gallop right, has just gone into air from the right
fore leg. The right hind leg was then planted, which will
be followed in turn by the left hind leg, then the right fore
leg, and lastly the left fore leg, from which the horse will
go into air; the change from gallop right to gallop left
having been made without disorder or a false step.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pn center">BREEDING THE SADDLE-HORSE</p>


<p class="pn p2">The thoroughbred is universally recognized as
the finest type of the horse, excelling all other
races in beauty, in stamina, in courage, and in
speed; and, further, it is capable in the highest
degree of transmitting to its posterity these valuable
qualities. Indeed, the greatest virtue possessed
by this noble animal lies in its power of
producing, upon inferior breeds, horses admirably
adapted to many useful purposes for which the
blooded animal itself is not fitted.</p>

<p>In England and upon the continent the thoroughbred
is held in high esteem for the saddle;
but, as General Basil Duke justly remarks, it has
not that agility so desirable in a riding-horse, and
because of its low action and extended stride it is
often wanting in sureness of foot, and in America
we prefer to ride the half-breed with better action.
Occasionally the thoroughbred is found that fills
the requirements of the most exacting rider, and
the author has had at least six blood-horses that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
were excellent under the saddle. One of these,
represented by a photograph in a previous work,
in a gallop about a lance held in the rider's hand,
gave sufficient proof of quickness and suppleness.
However, it is admitted on all hands that the
horse which most nearly approaches the thoroughbred,
and yet possesses the necessary qualities
which the superior animal lacks, will be the
best for riding purposes.</p>

<p>Although every thoroughbred traces its ancestry
in the direct male line to the Byerly Turk,
1690, the Darley Arabian, <i>circa</i> 1700, or the
Godolphin Barb, <i>circa</i> 1725, and "it is impossible
to find an English race-horse which does not
combine the blood of all three," the experience
of modern horsemen points to the fact that the
blood-horse is as near to the Eastern horse as we
should go with the stallion in breeding for the
race-course or for ennobling baser strains.</p>

<p>In view of the great influence that these three
horses had almost immediately upon English
breeds, this present exclusion of the Eastern
stallion is striking; but it means simply that the
race-horse of our day has more admirable qualities
to transmit than the sire of any other blood.</p>

<p class="p1">The Bedouin Arabian of the Nejd district, supposed
to be the purest strain of the race and the
fountainhead of all the Eastern breeds, has become
degenerate during the past two hundred years;
too often horses of this royal blood are found
undersized, calf-kneed, and deficient in many
points. Notwithstanding the virtues that such
animals may yet be able to transmit, I venture to
say that the disdained "Arab" of Turkey, Persia,
Egypt, and even that of Europe, as well as the
so-called Barb, are better and more useful horses,
and it is from these impure races that nearly all
of the Eastern blood has come that has found its
way into the crosses of European horses during
the past hundred years or more. Indeed, if we
may believe the statements of the partisans of the
Eastern horse, but very little of the best Arab
blood has been introduced into Europe.</p>

<p>The Darley Arabian, the ancestor of the best
strains in the world, was doubtless of pure desert
blood. His color, form, and other characteristics
have always satisfied horsemen that his lineage
could not be questioned.</p>

<p>In crosses of thoroughbred strains and desert
blood the stallion should be of the former race;
but in bringing Eastern blood into inferior breeds
the blood of the latter should be represented by
the mare. All good crosses are apt to produce
better riding-horses than those of a direct race.</p>

<p>From the fossil remains found in various parts
of the world it is certain that the horse appeared
in many places during a certain geological period,
and survived where the conditions were favorable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>But whether Western Asia is or is not the
home of the horse, he was doubtless domesticated
there in very early times, and it was from
Syria that the Egyptians received their horses
through their Bedouin conquerors. The horses
of the Babylonians probably came from Persia,
and the original source of all these may have
been Central Asia, from which last-named region
the animal also passed into Europe, if the horse
were not indigenous to some of the countries in
which history finds it. We learn that Sargon I.
(3800 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) rode in his chariot more than two
thousand years before there is an exhibition of
the horse in the Egyptian sculptures or proof of
its existence in Syria, and his kingdom of Akkad
bordered upon Persia, giving a strong presumption
that the desert horse came from the last-named
region, through Babylonian hands. It
seems, after an examination of the representations
upon the monuments, that the Eastern
horse has changed but little during thousands
of years. Taking a copy of one of the sculptures
of the palace of Ashur-bani-pal, supposed to have
been executed about the middle of the seventh
century before our era, and assuming that the
bare-headed men were 5 feet 8 inches in height,
I found that the horses would stand about 14½
hands&mdash;very near the normal size of the desert
horse of our day. The horses of ancient Greece
must have been starvelings from some Northern
clime, for the animals on the Parthenon frieze are
but a trifle over 12 hands in height, and are the
prototypes of the Norwegian Fiord pony&mdash;a
fixed type of a very valuable small horse.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The horse was found in Britain from the
earliest historical times, and new blood was introduced
by the Romans, by the Normans, and
under many of the successors of William the
Conqueror. The Turkish horse and the barb,
it is understood, were imported long before the
reign of James I., when Markham's Arabian, said
to be the first of pure desert blood, was brought
into the country; but from that time many
horses were introduced from the East, of strains
more or less pure. The Eastern horse was the
foundation upon which the Englishman reared
the thoroughbred, but we must not lose sight of
the skill of the builder nor of the material
furnished by native stock. The desert strains
furnished beauty, courage, and stamina; the native
blood gave size, stride, and many other good
qualities; the English breeder combined all these
and produced what no other nation has approached,
the incomparable thoroughbred.</p>

<p>We accept the thoroughbred as we find him.
No man can say exactly how he was produced.
The great Eclipse (1764) has upward of a
dozen mares in his short pedigree (he was fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in descent from the Darley Arabian) whose
breeding is unknown and which were doubtless
native mares, for already the descendants of
Eastern horses were known and noted. What
is true of the breeding of Eclipse is true of many
of his contemporaries who played prominent parts
in the studs of their day.</p>

<p>For more than one hundred years no desert-bred
stallion has had any marked influence upon
the race-horse directly through a thoroughbred
mare. In the first decade of the last century a
barb stallion bred to a barb mare produced
Sultana, who brought forth the granddam of
Berthune to Sir Archy. Berthune was much
sought after as a sire for riding-horses; besides
this barb blood he had strains of Diomed and of
Saltram in his veins, all of which were desirable
for saddle-horses.</p>

<p>Breeds of animals deteriorate rapidly through
lack of nourishment and from in-and-in breeding.
It is questionable whether a degenerate race may
be restored, within measurable time, by the use
of any appreciable amount of its own blood;
it is certainly bad policy to found a breed upon
poor stock. The better plan would be to form
the desired type from new strains. One hundred
years ago Lewis and Clark found upon the plains
of the Northwest "horses of an excellent race,
lofty, elegantly formed, and durable," but one
could hardly hope to replace such animals from
the cayuse ponies, their descendants, without the
introduction of superior blood in such quantities
as practically to obliterate the inferior.</p>

<p class="p1">Some of the range horses of Washington and
of Oregon are fairly good animals, and these
have more or less of the bronco blood, but all
that can be said of the influence of the wild horse
is that its descendants can "rustle" for a living
where an Eastern horse would starve, and the
same thing can be said of the donkey. Admitting
that for certain purposes inferior blood must
sometimes be introduced for domestic purposes,
the better the breeding the better the horse will
be. <i>Bon sang bon chien.</i></p>

<p>The mustang of the southern central plains
maintains many of the good qualities of its
Spanish ancestors, and is a valuable horse for
certain purposes, but we need not consider this
animal in breeding for the saddle when we have
so many other strains infinitely superior. Polo
and cow ponies are not within our intent.</p>

<p>Types and families of horses are produced either
by careful "selection and exclusion," or by the
chances of environment In the first manner
was brought about the thoroughbred, the Percheron,
the Orloff, the Trakhene, the Denmark,
and every other race or family of real value.</p>

<p>All over the world isolated groups of horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
may be found which have become types by an
accidental seclusion, and these from various
causes are usually undersized and often ill-formed.
Such are the mustang and its cousins on the
plains, many breeds in Eastern Asia, the Norwegian
Fiord pony, the Icelander, the Shetlander,
etc., the last-named three being, it is supposed,
degenerates of pure desert descent from animals
taken north from Constantinople by the returned
Varangians in the eleventh century.</p>

<p>In breeding for the saddle, or for any other
purpose, the mare should be nearly of the type
the breeder desires to obtain, and she should be of
strong frame, perfectly sound, of healthy stock,
and with a good disposition. If her pedigree be
known, the stallion, well-bred or thoroughbred,
should be selected from a strain which has been
proved to have an affinity with that of the mare.
The mingling of certain strains is almost as certain
to produce certain results&mdash;not, be it understood,
everything that may be desired&mdash;as does
the mixing of chosen colors on the palette. That
is to say, size, form, action, and disposition may
ordinarily be foretold by the mating between
families that are known to nick. The stallion
should be no larger than the mare, of a family in
which there is no suspicion of transmissible disease,
and of good temper, and it certainly should
not be lacking in the slightest degree in any point
where the mare is not fully developed. The mare
might be the stronger animal, the stallion the
more highly finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Where the mare's pedigree is unknown, and
the matter is purely an experiment, or where she
is undoubtedly of base breeding, the stallion,
while of superior blood, should not vary greatly
from her type. Peculiarities in either parent are
almost certain to be found in an exaggerated form
in the foal.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine a better horse,
for any conceivable purpose except racing, than a
first-rate heavy-weight hunter; yet he may be called
an accident, as there is no such breed, and his
full brother may be relegated to the coach or even
to the plough. The large head and convex face
almost invariably found in the weight carrier, and
in the "high-jumper," are derived from the coarse
blood which gives them size and power; but these
features are indications of that courage and resolution
which give them value&mdash;characteristics
which in animals of wholly cold blood are usually
exhibited in obstinacy. Indeed, while the English
horse, each in its class, has no superior, Great
Britain has no type or family of saddle animals
such as our Denmark, unless one except cobs and
ponies.</p>

<p>Of course, where two animals of the same or of
similar strains, and bearing a close resemblance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
each other, are mated, the type will be reproduced
with much greater certainty than where various
strains are for the first time brought together;
but even in good matches a foal may show some
undesirable feature derived from a remote ancestor.
Some marks or characteristics of a progenitor
reappear at almost incredible distances
from their sources. That Boston's progeny
should be subject to blindness, or that Cruiser's
descendants should be vicious, or that the offspring
of whistlers should prove defective in their
wind, are reasonable expectations; but that the
black spots on the haunches of Eclipse should be
repeated upon his descendants of our day, as is
doubtless the case, exhibits an influence that is
marvellous. Stockwell (1849) and many others
of Eclipse's descendants had those ancestral
marks, but Stockwell had many strains of Eclipse
blood through Waxy, Gohanna, and other progenitors.
When a chestnut thoroughbred shows
white hairs through its coat, that peculiarity
is ascribed to Venison (1833) blood, if by
chance that stallion's name may be found in its
pedigree.</p>

<p class="p1">Where undesirable qualities appear in the
products of crosses in breeding for a type, they
are bred out in breeding up, or the failures are
permitted to die out. It is not probable that any
one who was desirous of breeding a horse suitable
for the saddle would select a very inferior mare,
for, even though her pedigree were unknown,
the qualities which suggested her selection would
prove her something better. It cannot be denied
that occasionally a literal half-breed, by a thoroughbred
on common stock, turns out a good animal,
and such a cross is often the foundation of valuable
types; but the chances are too remote to
induce one to try the experiment solely for
the produce of the first cross. It is rarely the
case that a horse may be found in a gentleman's
stable that has not either a liberal, direct infusion
of thoroughbred strains, or is not itself a representative
of some family which owes its distinction
to the blood-horse.</p>

<p>I am schooling a pretty little mare, picked up
by chance, for the illustrations of the chapters
on riding and training. I believe that Daphne
is out of a Morgan mare by a Hambletonian
stallion, and that her symmetry comes from the
dam. It is greatly to be regretted that the so-called
Morgans have been so neglected that it is
not easy to find horses with enough of the blood
to entitle them to bear the family name. The
Morgan, although rather a small horse, was an
admirable animal, good in build, in constitution,
in action, and in temperament, and its blood combined
well with that of the old Canadian pacing
stock (of which the original Copperbottom was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
an example), with Messenger strains, and with
those of some other trotting families.</p>

<p>At the Trakhene stud in Germany a distinct
breed has been obtained by the admixture of
thoroughbred and Eastern blood. How long it
took and how many crosses were made to establish
the type I cannot say, but it is understood
that in the first crosses the stallions were of
English blood, the mares of desert strains. These
Trakhene horses, usually black or chestnut, are
very beautiful animals&mdash;large, symmetrical, and
of proud bearing. They are sometimes used as
chargers by the German emperor and his officers,
and in this country they are somewhat familiar as
liberty horses in the circus ring. It is said that
the Trakhene is not clever upon his feet and that
he is not safe in easy paces, which is likely
enough, for both the blood-horse and the Arab
are stumblers in the walk and in the trot.</p>

<p>In the province of Ontario, Canada, and in the
states of Maine and New York, very fine horses
are bred for various purposes; and from among
these are found good hacks and the animals best
suited to the hunting-field that America affords.
These Northern horses have good constitutions
and, it is thought, better feet than those found
beyond the Alleghanies, and the best examples
fill the demands of the most critical horseman;
but in none of the Northern states can it be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
that a breed or family exists that produces a type
of hack or hunter, while in the Blue Grass region
south of the Ohio we find the Denmarks splendidly
developed in every point and with a natural
grace and elasticity that make them most desirable
for the saddle.</p>

<p>For quite a century the riding-horses of Kentucky
have been celebrated in song and story.
In the days when bridle-paths were the chief
means of intercommunication throughout this
state, the pioneer made his journeys as easy as
possible by selecting and by breeding saddle-horses
with smooth gaits, the rack and the running
walk. These movements had been known
in the far East and in Latin countries from time
immemorial, but it remained for the Kentuckian
to perfect them.</p>

<p>Some fifty odd years since a stallion called
Denmark was introduced into Kentucky, and
from him there has descended a type of saddle-horse
which is everywhere held in esteem, for the
Denmark horse of to-day has no superior for
beauty of form, for docility, for graceful movements
and, indeed, for every good quality which
should be found in a riding animal. Denmark
had been successful on the race-course; he was by
imported Hedgeford, and if it be true that there
was a stain upon the lineage of his dam, there
had been a very successful cross, for the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
majority of the saddle-horses of Kentucky boast
Denmark as an ancestor. More than nine-tenths
of this family trace to the founder's son, Gaines's
Denmark, whose dam was by Cockspur, and,
probably, out of a pacing mare.</p>

<p>The American Saddle-horse Breeders' Association
has undertaken to improve the riding-horses
of this country by the formation of a register and
by the selection of foundation stallions whose
progeny under certain conditions shall be eligible
for registry. Their primary object is to encourage
the breeding of the gaited saddle-horse, that
is, the animal which, from inherited instincts or
natural adaptability, may readily be taught to
rack, to pace, to go in the running walk and in
the fox-trot; but at the same time General Castleman,
Colonel Nall, and the other gentlemen
engaged with them, are exercising great influence
for good upon the horse of the three simpler
gaits.</p>

<p>The pedigrees of the foundation sires of this
register show many strains of the blood of Saltram
and of Diomed, a fair share of that of the
Canadian pacer, and enough, doubtless, of that of
the Morgan. A fabric woven of such threads
must prove of national importance; for, although
the registry is open to all horses which can show
five saddle-gaits, it should be remembered that
such an exhibition is almost a certain proof of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
desired breeding and is a certain proof of quality.
We may, then, hope for a typical American saddle-horse,&mdash;a
race that shall have no superior, representatives
of which shall be found wherever the
horse flourishes.</p>

<p>I am no advocate for any paces other than the
walk, the trot, and the gallop, these being the only
movements in which the rider can obtain immediate
and precise control over the actions of the
horse. The riding-horse must be managed by
reins and heels; no motions or signs are so exacting,
so unmistakable in their demands, and it is
impossible readily to obtain movements from a
horse that is confused by eight or even five gaits,
particularly when some of these gaits require an
extension of the animal's forces incompatible with
the union required in quick turns and in immediate
obedience. It must, however, be acknowledged
that the rack, the running walk, and the
fox-trot have had a beneficial influence upon the
Kentucky saddle-horse. In the first place, these
paces required selection in the breeding, and,
secondly, the discipline implied by the training,
through many generations, has had its effect upon
the tempers and dispositions of these splendid
animals.</p>

<p>A brood mare should always be well nourished,
but not over fed, and, from the time it is able to
eat, the foal should have its share of oats as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
as of succulent, nutritious grasses, and of sound
hay when grazing is impracticable. Our cavalry
officers, and horsemen in general, bear testimony
to the endurance of animals bred in Kentucky.
This vigor is due to the rich blue-grass pastures
and to the liberal feeding of the mare and her
offspring.</p>

<p>It would appear, upon first viewing the subject,
that a horse bred upon rough pasture-land would
be more sure of foot than one bred on smooth
plains; but that is not always the case. It is true
that the animal bred on uneven ground learns to
look after itself, and becomes very clever on its
feet when obstacles exist, but mountain-bred
horses are often stumblers on level roads, in the
walk and in the trot. The fact is, that sureness
of foot depends upon the manner in which the
horse extends and plants its feet, moderate action
being the safest, either extremes of high or low
action, of short or long strides, militating against
the animal's agility. The reason that horses
stumble ten times in the walk to once in the
trot is because in the first-named pace the pointed
toe is usually carried along close to the ground
before the fore foot is planted. When the rider
unites the horse, this defective action is obviated.
During the past twenty years I have taken thousands
of photographs of the moving horse in
studying the question of action, and I am satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that the horse which plants its fore foot with the
front of the hoof vertical will stumble; that the
horse which straightens its joints and brings
the heel to the ground first will travel insecurely
and slip on greasy surfaces. I had an example of
the last-named in my stable, and the animal several
times "turned turtle," as I might have anticipated.
Fair action, with fairly bent joints which
bring the feet about flat to the ground, the hind
legs well under the mass, is the safest form in
which the horse moves.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pn center">HANDLING THE YOUNG HORSE</p>

<p class="pn p2">Before the horse can be taught obedience to
the bit and spur it must go through a preliminary
course of handling, by which the man obtains
mastery over the animal. This work is usually
called "breaking-in," and it is a matter of regret
that it is almost always conducted in an unnecessarily
harsh and rough manner, with the result
that many horses are made vicious, or are in
other ways spoiled, through the ignorance and
cruelty of those who have charge of their early
education.</p>

<p>A lively colt is shy, suspicious, and curious,
easily amused, and as easily bored; by recognizing
these characteristics and conducting his work
with reference to them, the trainer will find success
easy and agreeable. After the man has
gained the confidence of the animal, he will find
that the young horse takes great interest in lessons
that are varied and not too long continued,
and there need be no resistances aroused on the
part of the pupil. Except in the very rare cases
of animals that are naturally vicious, and such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
are insane, the training of a horse may be carried
on without friction. The faults and vices in a
horse usually arise from the efforts of the nervous
animal to avoid injudicious restraints before
it has been taught by easy steps to yield instinctively
to the demands of its trainer. Later misconduct
is almost always due to want of firmness
and decisive action on the part of the rider. The
horse is incapable of that real affection for man
such as the dog evinces toward the worst of masters;
it is of low intelligence, the boldest of them
being subject to panics, but there are few which
lack a low craft that enables them to take advantage
of every slip or mistake the man may make.
A sufficient amount of work and careful treatment
will keep a sane horse steady, but when at all
fresh most horses are untrustworthy if the man's
control be lost. I do not find it necessary to
punish my horses; the whip, spur, and reins are
employed to convey demands; a harsh word answers
every requirement for correction, and the
animal cannot resent it as it may the blows of
the whip or the stroke of the spur. The photographs
of a number of these animals in my various
works in almost every possible movement
prove how exact is the obedience they render
under this course of treatment. When some old
favorite refuses to walk into a coal-pit, or voluntarily
turns up some well-known road, the fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
owner is too apt to confuse instinct or habit with
brilliant mental operations, and place too much
faith in its good inclinations; but the fact is that
in handling this animal we must neglect its will
and obtain control over its movement by cultivating
the instinctive muscular actions which follow
the application of the hand and heel. I have a
great admiration for the horse, for its beauty, for
its usefulness, for its many excellent qualities, but
I do not permit this sentiment to blind me to its
shortcomings. Some horses are so good that
they inspire an affection which they cannot reciprocate.
Since I began this book I lost Silvana,
a well-bred English mare which I had owned for
eighteen years. She was a very beautiful animal,
of high spirit, exact in all the movements of the
manège, and of so kind a disposition that she was
never guilty of mutinous or disorderly conduct.</p>

<p>Regardless of the treatment it has received
previously, the young horse should be "broken
to ride," when strong enough to bear the weight
of a rider, by some method similar to that which
follows.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">But first I wish to say a word about casting
the horse, by what is usually called "The Rarey
System." Many people believe that to throw the
horse is a sure cure for every vice and spirit of
resistance. The fact is that a horse is confused,
surprised, and humiliated at finding itself helpless,
and casting does give the man temporary control
which is often a most important matter, and may
be the beginning of the establishment of discipline;
but mastering the horse permanently cannot
be accomplished in a moment, and unless it
be necessary to employ the straps in the handling
of a violent animal I should advise against it.
Vices, faults, and tricks may be remedied only
by careful training. I teach many of my horses
to lie down, but, as I shall explain later, I do not
employ any straps or apparatus.</p>

<p>The first step in breaking-in is to give some
lessons on the cavesson. This is a head-collar
with a metal nose-band, upon the front and each
side of which are stout rings. To the front ring a
leather longe line fifteen feet long will be fastened,
and from the side rings straps will be buckled to
the girth or surcingle at such lengths as will prevent
the horse extending its nose so that the face
is much beyond the perpendicular. The horse
thus fitted should be led to some retired spot
where there is level ground enough for a circle
of about forty feet. At first the man, walking at
the shoulder of the horse, should lead it on the
circumference of the circle, to the right and to
the left, taking a short hold of the longe line and
being careful that the animal does not get so far
ahead of him as to have a straight pull forward
which may drag him from his feet. From time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to time the man will bring the horse to a halt,
and require it to stand quite still, making much
of it by caresses and kind words, picking up the
feet and stroking it gently with the whiphandle
all over its body and legs, so that it will not be
alarmed at his future motions, and then continuing
the progress on the circle. Gradually the
length of the hold on the longe line will be
increased, until the horse goes about the man
at the full length of the strap. In these exercises,
also, the horse should frequently be brought to a
stop, always on the circumference of the circle,
and it should be worked equally to either hand.
The lessons should be given twice every day, at
first for about fifteen minutes each, and increasing
the time until a lesson shall be of three-quarters
of an hour's duration. Colored rugs, wheelbarrows,
open umbrellas, paper, and other similar
objects at which a horse might shy should be
placed near the path until the horse is so accustomed
to them that it will take no notice. Under
no circumstances should the horse be punished,
and the man should exercise great care that he
does nothing to make the animal fear him. When
the horse will go quietly about the man in the
walk and in the very slow trot (it should never be
permitted to go rapidly), the surcingle may be replaced
by the saddle, lightly girthed and the stirrups
looped up, the side-lines of the cavesson being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
removed. Then, at the end of each lesson on the
cavesson, that instrument should be replaced by a
light snaffle-bridle. The man, facing the head of
the horse, should take a snaffle-rein in each hand
and make gentle vibrations toward its chest, so that
he will give the bit a light feeling on the bars of
the mouth. Occasionally he will elevate the head
of the horse by extending his arms upward to
their full length, then gently bring the head of
the horse to a natural height, or to that height
which he judges will be the best in which the
trained horse should carry it, drawing the reins
toward the animal's chest until its face is perpendicular,
and no farther, and playing with the
bit in light vibrations until the horse takes up
the play and gives a supple jaw. He will also
bend the head of the horse to the right and to
the left, the face vertical, and bring it back to the
proper position by the reins, not accepting any
voluntary movement from the horse, and endeavoring
to obtain always an elastic resistance from its
mouth. The head of the horse will also be depressed
by the snaffle-reins, until it nearly touches
the ground, and then be lifted to the natural height.
All of these movements are of high importance,
and all of them tend to develop the muscles of
the neck and chest; but the elevation of the head
and its return to the right height, face vertical,
jaw supple, but not flaccid, produces the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
results in bitting and should be more frequently
practised than the others. If, in these lessons,
the horse draws back, it must be made to come
to the man; no good results can be obtained from
a retreating animal.</p>

<p>Upon some occasion, after the longeing and bitting
lesson has been given, when there is no high
wind to irritate the horse and the animal seems
to be composed, the man should have "a leg up"
and quietly drop into the saddle, having first
taken a lock of mane in his left hand and with
the right, in which the reins should be, grasping
the pommel, thumb under the throat of the pommel.
He should then let the horse walk off for a
few steps, having a very slight tension upon the
reins, and quietly dismount. If, as is very unlikely,
for the horse will be taken by surprise,
though not frightened, the animal makes a jump
or a plunge, the rider must maintain his seat,
keep up the head of the horse, and dismount
when the animal has become quiet. The horse
will not rear at this stage; that is an accomplishment
it learns from bad hands, and it is probable
that it will be perfectly quiet. Each day the riding
lesson will be lengthened, and the rider will
gradually obtain some control over its movements
by the reins and accustom it to bear the pressure
of his legs against its sides. The longeing will
now be employed to give such exercise as is
needed to keep the animal from being too fresh;
and when the riding lessons give sufficient work,
the longe may be dispensed with, to be resumed
if the horse falls into bad habits. But the bitting
exercises, previously described, should be occasionally
reverted to as long as the horse is used
under the saddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">But one more thing is necessary before the
horse is ready for the higher training which will
be described later, and this desideratum is to confirm
the horse in the habit of facing the bit, that
is, to go forward against a light tension upon the
reins; for without this the rider will have little or
no government over its movements, as the bit must
have some resistance, slight though it should be,
upon which to enforce his demands. Whenever
a rider finds that his hand has nothing to work
against, that the horse has loosened its hold on
the bit and refuses to face it, he may be almost
certain that he has an old offender to manage
and that mischief is meant, and will follow unless
he can force the horse up into the bridle.</p>

<p>The horse may best be taught to face the bit
in a slow but brisk trot. The animal must not
be started off too abruptly, but the forward movement
should begin in a walk; and this is a rule
that should always be followed, even though it be
for a few steps, unless some good reason for doing
otherwise exists. The impulse for the trot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
its continuance may be induced by a pressure of
the rider's legs against the sides of the horse,
or by light taps of the whip delivered just back
of the girths.</p>

<p class="p1">In a measured, regular trot the horse should be
ridden in straight lines, and in circles, first of
large, and afterward of decreased, diameters, the
pace being maintained by demanding impulses
from the hind quarters, the hand taking a light
but steady tension upon the reins. No effort
will be made to induce the horse to pull against
the hand, but the man should endeavor to get
just that resistance by which he may direct the
animal. It does not really matter if the jaw
of the horse does get a little rigid; that can be
softened by the bitting exercises and by future
lessons, but the horse must go into the bridle.
In turning to either hand the inside rein will
direct the movement, the outer rein measuring
and controlling the effect of the other; the outside
leg of the rider will make an increased pressure
as the turn is being made to keep the croup
of the horse on the path taken by the forehand.
On approaching the turn the horse will be slightly
collected between hand and heel, and as soon as
the horse enters upon the new direction it will be
put straight and the aids will act as before. To
bring it to a halt, the legs of the rider will close
against the sides of the horse; he will then lean
back slightly and raise his hand until the horse
comes to a walk, and in the same manner he will
bring it to a stop. The hand will then release
the tension upon the reins and the legs be withdrawn
from the sides of the horse. To go forward,
the rider will first close his legs against
the sides of the horse and meet the impulses so
procured by such a tension upon the reins as will
induce the horse to go forward in a walk. So, to
demand the trot, the increased impulses will first
be demanded from the croup, to be met and measured
by the hand. It is an invariable rule, at this
stage and in every stage, that in going forward,
backward, or to either side, the rider's legs will
act before the hand to procure the desired impulses.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pn center">THE PURCHASE, THE CARE, AND THE SALE OF THE
SADDLE-HORSE</p>

<p class="pn p2">Whether it has been procured by rapine, purchase,
gift, or devise, the owner of a really good
saddle-horse has something from which he may
derive much pleasure and satisfaction. Nor is
such an animal so rare as the late Edmund Tattersall
suggested, when he gave it as his opinion
that a man might have one good horse in his lifetime,
but certainly no more. Almost any horse
of good temper, safe action, and sufficient strength
may be made pleasant to ride. Alidor was a
small cart-horse, low at the shoulder, with a rigid
jaw and a coarse head, but he became a charming
hack, and I employed him for the photographs of
the first edition of "Modern Horsemanship." I
bought him as a three-year-old, as an experiment;
and when he was four the breeder came to see him
and gave me a written statement that, so great
were the changes made in appearance and action
by the calisthenics of his education, the animal
could hardly be recognized.</p>

<p>Of course a man on the lookout for a horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
will make an offer for a desirable animal wherever
it may be found, but the most satisfactory mode
of procedure is to go to some reputable dealer.
I have bought horses from dealers in many parts
of this country and in England, France, Germany,
and other parts of Europe, and I have found them
desirous of pleasing and as honest as their neighbors.
I once bought a little horse from a trader
in Frankfort-on-the-Main, who told me that I was
getting a good bargain, and that in case I ever
wished to dispose of it he would like to have a
refusal. When I was ready to sell, I sent word to
the dealer that a friend had offered me a fair advance
over the price I had paid, and to my surprise
he appeared and without remonstrance gave
me the amount my friend had named. I need
hardly say the horse was a good one, so I had
been well treated all round.</p>

<p>Much of the friction between purchaser and
dealer is usually due to the manner in which the
former conducts his part of the bargain. It is
not agreeable to a fair-minded man to be approached
as though he were a swindler, to be
offered one-half of the price he has set on his
property, and then perhaps to have a sound horse
returned because the buyer did not know what he
wanted. I do not wish to be understood as saying
that all dealers are honest; I have seen too
many who would not go straight; but it is reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to suppose that most men in a large way of
business, who have reputations for honest dealings
to maintain, will "do right" by a customer.</p>

<p>It is a mistake for an ignorant purchaser to
take a knowing friend with him for protection;
this will, in the eyes of the dealer, relieve him in
a great measure of responsibility. If the friend
is really a good judge, it is far better to let him
act alone, when he will be considered a client and
not an interloper trying to "crab" a sale, and therefore
free to deceive himself and his companion.</p>

<p>Some dealers will not give a warranty of
soundness, and a warranty is too often the cause
of disputes and of actions at law to make it
advisable either to give or to demand one. A
veterinary examination and a short trial must
suffice. Sometimes the seller requires that the
trial shall take place from his yards, to avoid the
risk of injury to valuable animals and that blackmail
so commonly levied by head grooms and
stablemen. In cases where the dealer objected
to sending his horse to another's stables, the
author has been in the habit of offering a fair
sum of money for the privilege, the amount to go
on the price of the horse should the sale be
effected; and this proposal has usually been
acceptable.</p>

<p>Where a trial has been allowed, or even where
the purchase has been made, if an indifferent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
horseman, recognizing his deficiencies, wishes to
assure himself of the wisdom of the step he is taking,
let him place a cold saddle upon the horse
when it is fresh, and immediately mount and go
upon the road.</p>

<p>If the animal does not buck or shy, and goes
fairly well, albeit a little gay, it is a prize not to
be disdained. Many horses, even with stall courage,
will go quietly if the saddle be warmed by
half an hour's contact with their backs, but will
plunge or buck if the rider mounts a saddle
freshly girthed. If a fresh horse will stand the
ordeal of a cold panel, it will not be apt to misbehave
under other trials.</p>

<p>Of course the confident rider will make his
essay as soon as the horse comes into his possession,
and if the new purchase does not come up
to his expectations, he will hope that his skill
may remedy the faults he discovers.</p>

<p>To go to the breeder implies a journey, to find
often only young horses that are not thoroughly
trained and almost always unused to the sights
and sounds of traffic, many of which are fearsome
to a country-bred horse. On the other hand, on
such a visit, the prospective purchaser has a better
opportunity of examining the animals offered
for sale, and from a knowledge of the pedigrees
and an examination of the progenitors he will be
able to form some idea of what may be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in the way of temperament and development; and
it will be a satisfaction to have a fixed price, although
it may not be a low one. Some of the
breeders in Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri, and
perhaps in other parts of the country, do not
send their stock to market until the animals are
thoroughly and admirably trained; and for a man
who purposes "making" his own horse, nothing
better could be found than one of the highly bred
youngsters from the Blue Grass region. In the
following chapter a few of the stock farms devoted
to the breeding of high-class saddle-horses
are described.</p>

<p>There remains, as sources of supply, the auction,
the friend who has a good horse which he
is willing to dispose of, and "the stable of the
gentleman who is breaking up his establishment
previously to a European trip."</p>

<p>It has now become a custom to send very valuable
high-class horses to the auction block, and
if a man is looking for something that has already
proved its superiority in the show-ring,
he may often find it his property by nodding to
the auctioneer. But, aside from the fact that
such an animal has probably reached its climax,
and that the same experienced care is demanded
to maintain its condition, it is not advisable for a
man to purchase such a horse except for exhibition
purposes. In the hands of a poor or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of a moderately good horseman, the animal will
rapidly deteriorate, for it will be trained beyond
his skill; and no rider who wishes to have a
comfortable mount should acquire a horse that
has had an education beyond the stage of being
really "quiet to ride," for he may then bring the
animal up to his requirements, whatever may be
the measure of his dexterity. As for the inferior
grades of horses offered under the hammer, it is
better to leave them to experts. Neither the
horse of a friend, nor that offered by the coper
who hires a private stable from which to entrap
the unwary, is to be recommended. Such dealings
bring sorrow.</p>

<p>The Ideal Saddle-horse! Any man with a
trained eye and ear should be able to recognize
it among a herd of others. Its satin robe should
be of a chestnut, bay, or brown color, with a silver
star on the forehead. It should have a fine, thin
mane, and a tail just heavy enough to set off
the haunches. It should be of a stature of no
more than 15½ hands at the withers, never more
than an inch less than that height; of symmetrical
form,&mdash;if anything appears to be wrong, it
is wrong,&mdash;with a broad, flat forehead, a face
neither concave nor convex, a small muzzle with
nostrils that can dilate until they show the fire
within, while soft hazel eyes beam forth brightly
and kindly. Its pointed ears, beautiful in form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
are set far apart, and by their motions express
the moods of the vivacious animal. The legs,
well muscled above, clean and hard below the
knees, are truly placed under the mass, the
drivers capable of propelling the weight of horse
and man with vigor,&mdash;the fore legs giving no
suggestion that the body is leaning forward, the
hind legs having no appearance of buttressing up
the body. The crest is marked, but not too
strongly, and the muscles below it play like
shadows as the animal proudly arches its tapering
neck, which buries itself in broadly divergent
jaws. The shoulder slopes rearward in such a
manner as to make the back seem shorter than
it really is, while the gentle dip of the saddle-place
invites one to mount. Its ability to speed
under weight is evidenced by a deep, broad chest,
its muscular thighs, its well covered limbs, and
the strong spine which ends in a dock fairly
carried from a nearly level croup. The hoofs
are of exactly the right size, the slope conforming
to that of the springy pasterns, pointing straight
forward, and with level bearings. Its paces should
be smooth, even, and regular, four rhythmic beats
in the walk, three in the controlled gallop, two
in the trot, while the action should only be
high enough for safe and graceful movements,
the stride not long enough to affect the animal's
agility. The temper should "be bold, be bold
but not too bold," unaccustomed objects arousing
the horse's curiosity rather than its fears, while
this mettle is dominated by the rider's hand as
it ever finds just that tension upon the reins that
it would meet in bending the end of a willow
branch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">While skill in horsemanship and the possession
of a good horse are to be highly considered,
all the pleasures of riding are not confined to
the expert with his splendid mount. Many men
who are never able to attain even tolerable proficiency
in the art get a great amount of recreation
and satisfaction in the exercise. The author has
a friend who, late in life, and when his figure had
developed beyond the stage where a secure seat
might be practicable, was accustomed to place
himself on the back of a quiet pacing-mare, in
one of those saddles with a towering horn on the
pommel and a fair-sized parapet on the cantle.
Thus equipped, he passed many happy hours in
going wherever the steady but headstrong Belle
was inclined. When the mare brought forth
some three-cornered progeny from registered
sires, her owner's delight was unbounded, for
he was then a breeder as well as a horseman.</p>

<p>No estimate can be made of the real value of
a riding-horse, or what a horse for a specific purpose
should cost; these depend on the man and
the horse. A really satisfactory, confidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
animal is worth whatever the man feels that he
is able to pay, "even to half his realm." A horse
that costs no more than a hundred dollars at four
or five years old may be made by care and training
of great intrinsic value; while other animals,
whose beauty and striking action have sold them
for thousands of dollars, may be dear at any
price. A good horse should bring a fair price,
but the purchaser should be certain that he is
paying for the horse, and not for the privilege of
seeing it well ridden by an expert. Except where
horses are bred in such numbers that the cost of
the keep of each is much reduced, there will be
very little change coming to the breeder out of
the few hundred dollars that he gets for a four-year-old
of some quality. The exceptional colt
which brings an exceptional price puts up the
average of profit, but it is to the dealer that the
long price usually goes.</p>

<p>When one sees the wretched cabins, called
boxes, hot in summer, draughty in winter, in
which horses are kept on many of the breeding
farms, and even on some of the race-courses, it
is a matter of wonder that health and condition
of the stock can be maintained under such circumstances.
Exposure to the inclemency of the
weather, however, is better than the pampering
which city horses usually find in close and overheated
stables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The stable should be reasonably warm in winter
and as cool in summer as may be, thoroughly
ventilated, without draughts, and with good drainage.
The light should be admitted from the rear
of the stalls; certainly a horse should not stand
facing a near window on a level with its head.
A gangway should be in the front of the stalls as
well as in the rear, and the horse should be fed
through an opening about sixteen inches wide in
the front of the stall. This narrow opening will
be beneficial to the sight of the horse, and the
animal cannot fight its neighbors. For more
than half a century the home stable of the author
has had such an arrangement, which proved perfectly
satisfactory. In that stable there were two
rows of stalls facing a middle gangway.</p>

<p>Except for sick or weary horses, the stall is
better than the loose box; in the former, stable discipline
is better kept up. In a loose box an idle
horse is apt to become too playful, and horse-play
too often degenerates into something worse, such
as biting and kicking.</p>

<p>The floor of the stable should be of hard bricks,
or of some combination of asphalt. The drainage
should be to the rear of the stalls, with a very
slight slope. If the drains are made under the
horse, the slopes are multiplied and the inclines
are greater than in the length of the stalls. Always
the horse should have an abundance of dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
straw, and for the night this should be renewed
or rearranged, so that the animal shall have a soft,
dry bed. The food should be varied, the quantity
depending upon the size of the horse, the
work demanded of it, and its appetite and digestion.
For a horse 15½ hands high, the size in
which agility and sufficient strength are usually
found, ten to twelve pounds of oats and the
same quantity of hay should be given daily
in three portions, when in hard work. When
the horse is merely exercised, four or five
pounds of oats and six pounds of hay will be
sufficient. When it is found that a horse does
not clean out its manger, the feed should be reduced.
In addition to the oats and hay, the
horse should have a few carrots two or three
times a week, occasionally an apple, and a steamed
mash of bran and crushed oats about once a week,
as an aperient, given preferably on the eve of
some day of rest. During the spring and summer
the animal should have a handful of fresh
grass, not clover, every day; but not more than
a good handful, for a larger quantity might bring
on some intestinal trouble, whereas the titbit
is greatly appreciated and is highly beneficial.
These dainties will be received with a good grace
from the master and will encourage friendly relations
between horse and man. Salt should be
given in very small quantities two or three times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a week, and the horse should have a frequent
supply of pure, unchilled water, given some time
before meals; if it is offered four or five times a
day, it will not be too often.</p>

<p>The horse should be out of the stable, except
in very inclement weather, for at least two hours
every day; eight hours of slow work, with a halt
for rest and refreshment after the first three hours,
is not too much for a horse in good condition.</p>

<p>During the Civil War, General John Morgan,
after two weeks of severe campaigning, marched
his cavalry command, without dismounting, a
distance of ninety-four miles in about thirty-five
hours. Many of the horses of Kentucky breeding
performed this work without flinching, and were
called upon to do further duty without respite.
Notwithstanding the vigor with which General
Morgan conducted this raid into Ohio, he was
overtaken by General Hobson after twenty-one
days of hard marching, in which a distance of
about seven hundred and fifty miles was covered.
On a previous occasion General Morgan marched
his cavalry ninety miles in about twenty-five
hours. Under somewhat similar circumstances
the "exigencies of the service" have on occasion
required the author to remain in the saddle, with
but momentary dismounting, if any, for from sixteen
to eighteen hours, sometimes riding at the
gallop, and the horse, a thoroughbred by Albion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
never exhibited distress. Nor will he ever forget
that, on the first day of January, 1863, he rode a
little mustang from daylight until midnight, without
leaving the saddle, except when the horse fell,
twice upon a frosty hillside and once on a bit
of corduroy road. But such demands upon the
endurance of a horse, and, if I may say it, of the
man, are not unusual in active military service.</p>

<p>A horse should never be struck or otherwise
punished in the stable, and the first exhibition of
cruelty on the part of the groom should be the
cause of his dismissal.</p>

<p>The currycomb should be used only for cleaning
the brush, and never should be applied to the
skin of the horse; but so great is the temptation
to use it on a mud-covered animal that it is
better to abolish the instrument. A whalebone
mud brush, a strong straw brush, a smoothing
brush, a soft cotton cloth, and several good
sponges, together with some wisps of clean straw,
should be the only articles of the toilet.</p>

<p>The face and nostrils, the dock, and other hairless
parts of the horse should be washed daily;
but, except to cleanse sores or for wet bandages,
water should never be put upon the legs of the
horse. Tight bandages are permissible only
when applied by a skilled groom, or under
the orders of a veterinary surgeon. Massage,
rubbing the legs of the horse with the hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
downward, should take the place of bandages
except when support is really needed, and then
the advice of the professional should be called.</p>

<p>When a horse comes in from a hard day's
work, covered with mud, dry serge bandages may
be loosely put on the legs while the other parts
of the body are receiving the services of the
rubber. By the time that the body of the horse
is clean the mud upon the legs will have dried,
and, the bandages being removed, the dirt may
easily be brushed out, a good hand-rubbing
following. The hoofs should then be cleaned
out and washed, and the horse be placed in its
stall knee-deep in straw. Should a horse be
brought in late and really "done up" by its
work, it will be better to give it a pail of warm
gruel, rub dry the saddle-place, and turn it into
a warm box-stall at once, without annoying it
with the brushing and handling that would be
necessary to clean it thoroughly. No weary
horse, no matter how dirty it may be, has ever
been the worse for a few hours of complete rest
under such circumstances, for the quiet will be
of far more importance than the dressing. But
this course should be followed only under the
directions of the master, who should always see
that his overworked horses get the attention they
require, if he does not superintend the general
stable work from time to time as he should.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>When the hairs of the tail require cleaning, it
is well to use plenty of unchilled water, pretty
well saturated with salt, washing the dock also
with the solution; and this should be used whenever
the horse shows a disposition to rub its tail
against the side of the stall The horse should
be dressed in some covered place that is shut off
from the stalls; and the owner should, occasionally
at least, look in on his horses when they are
being dressed and at feeding time; and should
he find that he is not master of his own stables, he
should change his groom or give over keeping
horses.</p>

<p>This page is being written while the thermometer
is playing about zero and a cold north wind
is blustering round the corners of the house,
which state of affairs suggests that, when it can
be afforded, it is expedient to have a covered ride
in which horses may be exercised and trained in
stormy weather. An area 35 feet by 70 feet is
quite large enough for twelve or more horses,
and the many turns and bends required by the
limited space will improve the horses therein
exercised in every particular. Then the otherwise
weary days of winter may be made enjoyable
to the horseman by musical rides, for many pretty
and intricate figures may be formed by ten or
twelve riders. My riding-house is 28 feet by 60,
and it is quite large enough for my purposes, as I
always work my horses singly and without an
attendant. In London I saw Corradini training
a manège horse in the gangway of a stable, behind
a row of stalls; he had a space of about 8 feet
by 30. I believe that the horse was never
galloped until it was ridden in public in the circus
ring, but the schooling it had received made it
fit for any movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">A little study and a little experience should
teach a man much regarding the shoeing of his
horse. If the animal has true and level action, it
should have light irons all round. If it shambles,
or if the stride is too confined, the weight of the
shoes should be increased. The upper surface of
the iron, which comes next to the hoof, should be
flat; the lower surface may be bevelled from the
outside, or have a groove in which the holes for
the nails are punched. The hind shoes should
have very small calks, the toes being correspondingly
thickened to give a level bearing. Only so
much of the crust or wall of the hoof should be
removed as will give the foot a level bearing,
keeping the toe straight and the face of the hoof
with the slope which conforms to that of the
pastern. The bars at the heels should not be
cut away, except upon the recommendation of a
veterinary, and the frog and sole should have
nothing removed from them beyond the loose
flakes that show themselves as those parts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
renewed. The shoe should then be made to fit
the prepared hoof, and fastened by no more than
five nails, three on the outside quarter, two on the
inside, the protruding ends of the nails being cut
off and the exposed points clinched. The outer
wall of the hoof must not be rasped or scraped.</p>

<p>Turned-in toes or toes turned out may be produced
by bad shoeing, or, when natural malformations,
be mitigated more or less by good work, a
glance at the foot showing what is required in
each case. So brushing, interfering, overreaching,
forging, bowed tendons, and many other
disorders may be produced or prevented. No
horse should be sent to the forge unattended
unless the smith is a master of his craft, a white
blackbird. For ice-covered roads and for slippery
asphalt streets, I have found no shoes equal
to Dryden's rubber pads.</p>

<p>When it is no longer advisable to retain a
horse, it will usually be found that a satisfactory
sale is even more difficult than a satisfactory
purchase. The saying "first loss is best"
applies in this case with force. If a dealer will
not take the animal, it is better to send it to
the auction block than to hold on indefinitely
for a chance buyer. If the seller desires to keep
in touch with the horse and to be kept informed
of its future, he will give a warranty.</p>

<p class="pn center">SOME SADDLE-HORSE STOCK FARMS</p>

<p class="pn p2">With Lexington, Kentucky, as a centre one
may, with a radius of thirty miles, describe a circumference
which will embrace more fine horses
than any area of like extent upon the globe.
Here is the home of the American saddle-horse,
a well-bred animal that has no superior for pleasure
riding. There were good saddle-horses in
Kentucky before Denmark, Hedgeford's celebrated
son, made his appearance; but it was
largely to the influence of this stallion upon
suitable stocks that the superb animals now
under consideration owe their existence, for few,
if any, of these horses are without some strains
of Denmark blood, even a slight infusion seeming
to have great effect. From Kentucky these
saddle-horses have found their way into Illinois,
Missouri, Tennessee, and other states, and have
always met with appreciation for their excellent
qualities.</p>

<p>The grazing region of central Kentucky has
a gently undulating surface, watered with pretty
streams and artificial lakes; on every hand are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
groves of noble trees in sufficient number to
diversify the landscape; and a carpet of rich
green turf is spread over the ground, even where
the shade is most dense. The climate, the nutritious
food, and the intelligent care of man have
made these pastures celebrated the world over
for the character of the domestic animals they
produce.</p>

<p>Within short railway journeys of Lexington,
through a lovely, smiling country, are a number
of stock farms devoted to the breeding of riding-horses;
for, although the stupidity of "the
market" demands that these animals shall be
quiet to drive, they are bred on purely saddle-horse
lines, and the breeder hopes that no animal
leaving his hands will ever be called upon to look
through a collar. I have known of one case
where a farmer asked the privilege of taking back
a very fine animal at the purchase price rather
than see it put to harness work.</p>

<p>A soldier throughout two wars, an active and
efficient park commissioner in Louisville, the
city of his adoption, a man of extensive travel
and one prominent in many affairs, General John
B. Castleman has felt it his duty, as well as his
pleasure, to give much time and attention to the
improvement of the saddle-horse. Emily, winner
of the first premium over mares of any age at the
Columbian Exposition, Dorothy, with a clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
record in seventy show rings, Matilda, who met
defeat but once in fifty competitions, and many
other fine animals were reared by this gentleman.
Some years since General Castleman removed his
breeding establishment to Clifton Farm, Mercer
County, and he has recently placed it in the
hands of his son, Major David Castleman. Here,
upon a range of eight hundred acres, may be
found horses of only the most select strains, bred
upon lines which have been proved true after
years of study and experiment. At the head of
the stud is Cecil Palmer, a splendid animal,
of perfect paces, and in whose pedigree may
be found the names of Denmark, Cockspur,
Whip, Gray Eagle, Vermont Black Hawk, and
other horses whose blood is in the best representatives
of the saddle-animal.</p>

<p>The horses of Clifton Farm are broken to ride
at two years of age, and their education is carried
on very slowly and most carefully. The foal
almost invariably takes naturally to "the five
gaits," but no effort is made to force the animal
into any particular pace; and if the influence of
some remote trotting ancestor exhibits itself in
an indisposition to take the rack or the running
walk, the animal is not required to accept such
accomplishments. The writer saw Major Castleman
ride Garrard, a two-year-old, in the slow
gallop (or canter), the complacency, tempo, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
action of which would have been creditable to a
park hack of mature years and careful training.
Indeed, the docility of these riding-horses, observed
everywhere in a rather thorough tour, was
remarkable.</p>

<p>A ride of fifteen or twenty minutes from Lexington,
upon the Southern railway, will bring
the visitor to Pisgah, where he will find the establishment
of the Gay Brothers, the largest farm
devoted to the rearing of saddle-horses in this
country. Here about three hundred choice animals
have the freedom of nearly one thousand
acres of blue-grass pasture. At the head of the
stud is Highland Denmark, a true type of his
family, the sire of more prize winners and fine
foals than any stallion in the state. At the Louisville
Horse Show, in 1903, the descendants of
this horse gained first honors in the classes for
two-year-olds, for three-year-olds, for four-year-olds,
for the best registered saddle-horse, and for
the championship ($1000 value). He is the sire
of Motto and of Elsa, well known throughout
the country. Highland Denmark is a magnificent
animal, 16 hands in height, of splendid
form and graceful movements, docile in temper,
and, although he runs loose and "has not had a
stable door shut in his face" for five years, his
beautiful dark bay coat shines like satin. No
stock that the writer saw in Kentucky was in
better condition than that of the Gay Brothers,
the foals of the present year being particularly
strong and active.</p>

<p class="p1">The Gay Brothers break their horses to saddle
at two years of age; at three years of age their
education is enlarged; and at four they are ready
for purchasers, and none of them remain on hand
unless retained for some specific purpose. So
great is the demand for horses of this class, that
breeders could readily dispose of more than double
the numbers they can furnish, and dealers and
other purchasers find it difficult to obtain very
desirable horses of four years and upward. Some
dealers buy weanlings and yearlings to make
sure of the produce of certain well-known mares,
and it is by no means a rare case that a foal makes
its appearance in the world, the property of some
one other than the breeder who has anticipated
its birth.</p>

<p>The saddle-horse farm next in size to that of
Gay Brothers is that of Colonel John T. Woodford,
near Mount Sterling, about thirty miles from
Lexington. Colonel Woodford is well and favorably
known, not only throughout his native state,
but wherever the Kentucky saddle-horse finds
admirers; and many of his horses are sold to
clients who have never seen his animals, but who
rely upon Colonel Woodford to carry out their
wishes. Indeed, more than one disinterested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
admirer volunteered the information to the writer
that the purchaser who trusted to Colonel Woodford's
choice was apt to fare better than he who
made his own selection with less knowledge of
the animal. At the head of this stud is Forest
Denmark, a famous sire. Then comes Stirling
Chief, a fine chestnut stallion, well bred and truly
made, of vigorous but graceful action, exact paces,
and a kind disposition, half-brother to Montgomery
Chief and to Bourbon King, the two most
highly admired stallions of their class. Here, too,
are Dickens, a beautiful horse of a rich brown coat,
and Lexington, both Denmarks on the side of sire
and of dam. This breeding is not so usual as
might be supposed, although one of the best
judges of saddle-horses in the state of Kentucky
spoke the general sentiment when he said that a
saddle-horse could not have too much Denmark
blood. About one hundred animals of various
ages, all of the best strains, fill up the tale.
Colonel Woodford does not break his horses to
saddle until they are in their fourth year, as he
desires that they should have strength and development
before they undergo training; but their
excellent dispositions and the handling incident
to their care make them quiet and easy to manage
and quick to learn.</p>

<p class="p1">Five miles from Versailles, a short journey from
Lexington, one finds the farm of the Ball Brothers.
This is the home of Montgomery Chief, the grand
horse that has fairly carried off the honors wherever
he has been shown. In 1902 he won the
championship at Louisville, Nashville, Indianapolis,
Kansas City, St. Louis, and Chicago. In
1903, barred at Louisville, he was champion at
Kansas City ($1000 prize), Chicago, St. Louis,
and Atlanta. In 1904 he was first in his class at
the St. Louis Exposition. Of imposing size, great
substance, faultless form, golden coat, proud carriage,
and brilliant action, Montgomery Chief is an
admirable animal. His qualities seem too great
for everyday use, and he is worthy of bearing an
emperor at the head of a victorious army. If during
his career the country had a more beautiful
saddle stallion, it is to be regretted that no such
appearance was made, and this horse must be considered
the greatest of his class and day until his
colors are taken from him in public competition.</p>

<p>It must not be understood that excellent saddle-horses
may be found only on the large stock farms,
where the selection is greater and the chances
are greater. There is a good horse for nearly
every holding in the Blue Grass region, and the
man who breeds his only mare may through good
luck, aiding good judgment, rear a Montgomery
Chief or a Bourbon King, the last-named, I may
say, being a young horse selected by many of the
best judges to bear away the bell in future contests.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pn center">THE SADDLE&mdash;THE BRIDLE&mdash;HOW TO MOUNT</p>

<p class="pn p2">The English or flat saddle, is the only one fit
for sport or pleasure. It gives no trouble in
mounting or dismounting, it is the only form
which permits every man to obtain the true seat,
and it is far and away the most comfortable tree
when a horse falls with its rider. It is used by
civilians throughout the civilized world, and by
military men in their sports and whenever its use
by them is permissible. Indeed, the nearer the
requirements of the military saddle allow it to approach
the English saddle, the better.</p>

<p>The tree of the saddle should have a cut-back
pommel to prevent the withers of the horse from
being chafed. The side-bars should take an even
bearing upon each side of the horse's back, a
channel in the panel being made to keep the
saddle clear of the spine. The throat of the tree
should not be narrow enough to pinch the horse;
if too broad, it will not be stable. The tree being
suitable in other respects, it will be very easy to
bend the lower points until they embrace the
shoulders snugly, and to have a well-fitted saddle.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill100a" id="ill100a">100a</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The stirrups should be of tempered steel, of
large size and not too light, with the tread at
least an inch in breadth. When the panel, or
under stuffing of the saddle, has been found to be
right, care should be taken to preserve it, as it is
very difficult to find a saddler who will replace it
exactly. A cloth of felt or a piece of thin leather
under the saddle will preserve the panel for
many years. In places where I have found it
impossible to have the panel satisfactorily fitted,
I have removed it altogether, and girthed the
saddle over thick felt numnah, a proceeding which
answered perfectly. Saddle-galls are always due
either to an ill-fitting tree or an ill-fitting rider;
they are preventable, they should not exist.</p>

<p>The saddle having been found to suit the horse,
the rider may consider his own comfort and convenience.
It is always better, where skilful workmen
can be found, to buy the tree of the right
length and have the saddle finished to suit horse
and rider. The web foundation of the seat can
readily be arranged, before the pigskin is put on,
so that the dip will suit the conformation of the
man. The dip, or lowest point of the seat, should
be slight. If too far to the rear, it will give the
man a sensation of falling back; if too far to the
front, it will throw his body forward. When, sitting
upon his buttocks, he finds that he maintains
a perfectly erect seat without restraint, it is just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
right. Where saddlers do not know their trade,
it only remains to try finished saddles until the
horse and the man are suited.</p>

<p>The whip should be a light, straight, flexible
contrivance, with no more of a lash than a silken
tip. The use of the crop, except in the hunting-field,
is an absurdity. Fashion dictates that the
whip should be held nearly straight in the right
hand and pointing across the withers of the horse;
but Fashion is not a horseman. As the whip
should give strokes upon the forehand of the
horse only under exceptional circumstances,
common sense dictates that the instrument should
be held point down, so that it may be applied
with facility against the side of the horse just back
of the girths&mdash;the proper place for its effects to
produce increased impulses from the croup. With
a woman the riding rod takes the place of the
right leg of the horseman, and it is impossible to
use it in that manner if it is held across the
shoulders of the horse.</p>

<p>There are but two bridle bits for riding purposes.
The first and most useful is the snaffle, a smooth,
round mouthpiece, jointed in the middle, with
rings, and, where it is employed alone, with cheek-pieces
also on the ends. The snaffle is the bit for
the beginner, because he can do little harm with it;
and it is the bit for the accomplished horseman,
because in his hands it has a great range of effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The curb-bit should never be used without the
snaffle, as there are often occasions when the
powers of the curb-bit alone are ineffectual, and
the snaffle must go to its assistance. The mouthpiece
of the curb-bit is rigid, with a raised middle,
or "port," to give ease to the tongue of the horse
and to let the mouthpiece come down upon the
bars of the animal's lower jaw. Upon each end of
the mouthpiece is an arm, the upper branch of
which has a fixed ring for the cheek-piece of the
bridle, the lower branch having a loose ring to
receive the rein. The lower branch of this arm,
measuring from the middle of the mouthpiece
to the middle of the lower ring, should be
3½ inches in length. The upper branch, measuring
from the middle of the mouthpiece to the
highest part of the ring, into which the headstall
is buckled, should be 1¾ inches in length, the
assumed depth of the lower jaw of the horse.
These measurements are as nearly exact as may
be, to get the effects of a lever of the second class
upon such a yielding and changeable thing as the
head of the horse, the animal being, say, 15½ hands
high, of normal form. Upon the ring of the
upper branches metal hooks are fastened, and to
these the curb-chain is attached. When the curb-chain,
its links twisted until the chain is flat, fits
properly in the chin groove of the horse, directly
opposite to the cannons of the bit, that point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
becomes the fulcrum of the lever, and the power
being applied through the reins to the long
branches, the effects are applied to the bars of
the lower jaw. The width of the mouthpiece will
depend upon that of the animal's jaw; it should
not be so narrow as to pinch the muzzle between
the branches, nor so wide as to have an annoying
play.</p>

<p>To place the double bridle upon the horse, the
groom should approach the animal on the near
side, his left arm carrying the bridle by the head-piece
and reins. Then, the stall halter having
been removed, he will pass the reins over the
head of the horse until they rest upon the neck
near the withers; taking the bridle in the right
hand by the head-piece, so that the nose of the
horse goes between the cheek-pieces, he will raise
the bridle until the bits are about to touch the
animal's lips; then, opening its mouth with the
thumb of the left hand, he will gently insert
the bits and slip the head-piece over the poll of
the horse and see that the ears are free, finally
fastening the throat-lash loosely.</p>

<p>The bridle should be so fitted that the snaffle
lies snugly up in the corners of the horse's mouth
without pressing against the lips. The curb-bit,
lower in the mouth, should rest upon the bare
bars just above the tusks of the horse or the place
where they are usually found in the male. The
curb-chain should not be fastened until the rider
is about to mount, and a horse should never be led
while the curb-chain is hooked on both sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In hooking up the curb-chain it should first be
seen that on the far side it is outside of the
snaffle; then it should be twisted until it is quite
flat and hooked up on the near side outside of the
snaffle, at just such a length as to lie smoothly in
the chin groove. To test the accuracy of this the
curb-reins should be seized under the jaw of the
horse and drawn toward its chest. If the bit
stands stiffly, the chain is too tight. If the
branches of the curb-bit come back in a line with
the reins or anywhere near it, the chain is too
loose. The chain will be found to be of the right
length when, maintaining its place in the chin
groove, a slight tension upon the reins gives such
a pressure upon the jaw of the horse. If the
curb-chain be not brought from one hook to the
other on the outside of the snaffle, it will interfere
with the action of both bits and will pinch the
lips of the horse. On more than half of the
saddle-horses I look at, this important rule is not
observed.</p>

<p>It is the usual and better custom to have the
horse turn in its stall when the halter is taken off,
and to bridle it as it stands with tail to the
manger. Then the horse is led to the gangway
and the saddle put on; if the saddling has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
been done some half-hour previously, as is to be
recommended.</p>

<p>In saddling the horse the first care is to see
that the panel is perfectly clean and dry, then that
the hairs on the back of the horse lie smoothly;
the saddle, with the girths and stirrup leathers
crossed over the seat, should be lifted gently on
to the back of the horse, and put exactly in the
saddle-place, which is as far forward as it will
remain fixed and yet clear the withers and give
the shoulders free play.</p>

<p>Unless a rider is accustomed to mounting, and
that in some settled manner, it is often a very
awkward performance. Provided he does not
pull at the cantle and so bring the saddle awry to
gall the horse, it does not matter greatly how he
gets safely on the back of the horse. He may,
standing on the near side of the horse, either take
the reins in his right hand and with it clasp the
pommel of the saddle, insert his left foot in the
stirrup, spring from the ball of the right foot, and,
seizing a lock of the mane, steady himself until he
carries his right leg over the croup and so sink into
the saddle; or, facing to the rear, he may take the
reins in his left hand and with it seize a lock of
the mane, then, inserting his left foot in the stirrup,
spring from the right foot, and as he rises take
hold of the pommel of the saddle, carry his right
leg over the back of the horse, and when he has
found his seat transfer the reins to his right hand.
By the former manner he will have the advantage
of being able to control the horse, in case it goes
forward, as the right hand, holding the reins, may
readily be freed from the pommel. The latter
mode is, perhaps, less difficult, especially with a
tall horse. If the animal is restless, the rider may
have "a leg up," as the jockeys do, by taking
grasps of the mane and pommel and having an
attendant seize his left leg above the ankle and
aid him in rising to the position from which
he may carry his right leg over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In dismounting with the stirrup, the rider
should first release his right foot; then, transferring
the reins to his right hand, he should with it
seize the pommel and with his left hand take a
lock of the mane; then, taking his weight upon
his left foot, supported by his hands, he should
carry his right leg over the croup, face the horse,
and come gently to the ground on his right foot,
finally releasing his left foot and his holds upon
mane and pommel, the reins being retained, to
control the horse.</p>

<p>Any man of ordinary activity should be able to
vault into the saddle without the aid of the stirrup
or the assistance of a groom, whether the horse
be standing or moving, even in the gallop. Indeed,
by taking advantage of the movements of
the animal, a man may more readily vault into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
saddle of a horse that is not at rest than when it
is standing quietly, provided that he can get at
the near shoulder of the horse and secure his
clasps upon the mane and the pommel. That is, if
he can get the proper holds, from the right position,
no horse can prevent his gaining his seat.</p>

<p>To vault into the saddle, the man should stand
facing the near shoulder of the horse. In the left
hand he should take a lock of the mane, halfway
between the ears and the withers, and, with the
right hand resting on the front of the saddle, he
should grasp the throat of the pommel, thumb
under, fingers pointing to the ground over the
right side of the horse. Then, springing from
the balls of both feet, he should take his weight
upon his extended arms and, carrying his right
leg over the croup of the horse, sink into his seat.
Should the horse be plunging or moving, the man
will mark the time of some forward impulse, and
springing with it reach the saddle without making
the exact position on the extended arms; in
other words, he will throw himself upon the horse
as it pulls him forward. Always in mounting, by
this or by any other method, except that secondly
described, the reins should be taken in the right
hand and held by pressure against the pommel,
so that in case of failure the rider will be able to
control his horse; when his seat is secured, the
rider will pass the reins into the bridle-hand.</p>

<p class="p1">To dismount without stirrups, the rider should
transfer the reins to his right hand, take the holds
on mane and pommel as in mounting, lean far forward,
and, taking his weight upon his flexed arms,
carry his right leg back over the croup to the near
side, and drop gently to the ground.</p>

<p>In dismounting from a moving horse&mdash;and
this can readily be done even at a moderate gallop&mdash;the
rider should be ready to take a few
steps in the direction of progress as he reaches
the ground, in order that he may maintain his
equilibrium.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pn center">THE SEAT&mdash;GENERAL HORSEMANSHIP</p>

<p class="pn p2">The most important thing in horsemanship is
the acquirement of a stable seat, for without it
not only is the rider insecure, but it is impossible
that the hand should act with lightness and precision
if his seat is so feeble that under any circumstances
he should depend upon the reins for
maintaining his position on the horse.</p>

<p>Whether it be for pleasure, sport, or war, a
man has one seat that is the best possible. This
is readily obtained, even upon mounting the horse
for the first time; but to keep it exactly under the
more or less vigorous movements of the horse
requires long practice and a suppleness of the
body in every part, that comes from carefully followed
exercises in the saddle.</p>

<p>The seat about to be described was that of the
earliest riders, represented by Pheidias, described
by Xenophon, employed by the Bedouins and
other Eastern horsemen, when no cumbrous trees
with a dip of varying parts of a circle interfered
with a position that was safe, natural, and rational,&mdash;the
seat in use before those saddles which held
the rider between high pommels and high cantles
demanding a standing posture in the stirrups that
prohibited the grasp of the knees and thighs and
the pliancy of the body which gives friction and
balance to the mounted man.</p>

<p class="p1">I may say here that the saddletree was not
used until the Romans introduced it sometime
in the fourth century, and the stirrup followed in
the seventh century, first as an aid in mounting
and finally as a support. The Greeks and their
ancestors and the horsemen of the Euphrates
Valley rode upon cloths and skins, without stirrups
and without trees. The first mention of the
horse that we find upon the monuments is supposed
to date about 3800 years before our era.
The first representation of the horse is upon a
little wooden disk now in the British Museum, in
which two horses attached to a chariot by harnesses
that closely resemble those now in use are
shown; and this work is ascribed to Aahmes I.
(about 1700 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) and suggests that the animal
was introduced into Egypt by the Hyksos (possibly
Bedouins), as they had possession of the
country previously. I cannot find any representations
of mounted men earlier than the sculptures
upon the Assyrian monuments, attributed to
the middle of the seventh century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> It would
seem from the inscriptions and from historical
writings that, both in war and in the chase, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
horse was in very early times first and most frequently
used in harness; and there can be no
doubt that in ancient days chariots were employed
in charging bodies of the enemy just as
modern cavalry are used. The residents of mountainous
countries, I venture to say, were the first
to use cavalry. Wherever the ancient rider is
shown upon the monuments, before the introduction
of the saddletree, he has exactly the seat of
the modern, the only possible seat upon a flat or
treeless saddle.</p>

<p>The variations which appear in the seats of
modern horsemen are observable in the positions
of the lower parts of the leg from the knee down,
and such may be passed over as negligible quantities,
for the principles are everywhere observed;
and while it is doubtless better that there should
be no deviations from the canons of the art in
any particular, circumstances sometimes demand
trifling changes, as when the soldier's kit requires
the lower parts of his legs to be carried unduly
to the rear of the perpendicular, or when the cross-country
rider drives his feet home, to secure the
irons, and so obtains rigid, insensible bearing instead
of the lively, springy contact of the balls of
the toes. It is like walking on the heels. For
the best results, that pressure only should be given
to the tread of the stirrup that will hold the iron
with an elastic touch; <i>any undue weight will force</i>
<i>the seat</i>, as can plainly be understood. This forcing
of the seat is usually avoided by the rider
carrying his feet to the rear when the horse
springs in jumping, and then he depends upon
his true seat without the aid of the stirrups;
where this is not done, the rider does not stick
very closely to his saddle, as many of the photographs
of leaping horses show. I do not say
that it is not necessary on occasion to ride with
the feet home, but I do say, that it gives a stiff
seat, and that it should only be followed when
the necessity arises; certainly not for pleasure
riding, where that mode, as well as the crop, are
unsuitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">On page 200 of that admirable work, "Horses,
Saddles, and Bridles," General Carter gives a
photographic illustration of the American military
seat, which is an absolutely perfect representation
of the seat about to be described. The
photographs of the best riders of the various
countries reproduced here exhibit the same
type; and it will be observed that where the
most violent exertions of the horse are to be
expected the saddle is of the English form, for
in it the friction and balance which insure firmness
are found in the highest degree.</p>

<p>The flat race jockey is a striking exception to
what has been said of horsemen's seats, and the
ridiculous and tottering pose he assumes is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
throw as much of the weight as possible on the
shoulder of the sprinter, in order that the drivers
of the hind quarters may have free play. But
when the Jock comes to steeplechasing, he
lengthens his stirrup leather and rides like a
man.</p>

<p>The man may find his own best seat in the
following manner: mounting the horse, he should
sit down in the saddle, taking his weight upon
his buttocks, while he holds his body erect, the
shoulders held back squarely, his chin slightly
withdrawn, while his arms hang down loosely.
He should then, without disturbance in any other
part of his body, raise his legs upward and inward
until the points of his knees meet above
the crest of the horse. From this position he
will drop his legs slowly until the inner sides of
his thighs and the flat inner surfaces of his bent
knees take every possible point of contact with
the saddle, the lower parts of the legs hanging
without stiffness. There can be no question with
regard to the height and position of the knees.
Should they be too high, the upper surfaces of
the thigh will have contact with the saddle;
should they be too low, the under surfaces of the
thigh will find the saddle, when the points of the
knees take this hold. The jockey seat is the extreme
type of the first-named condition, the
armor-clad knight an extreme type of the latter.
The length of the stirrup leathers will be right
when the tread of the iron strikes the heels.
When the rider's feet are inserted in the stirrups,
it will be found that without effort they are
parallel with the sides of the horse, and very
slightly in rear of the perpendicular. From this
erect position upon his buttocks, together with
the grasp of the knees and thighs, the rider has
the strongest and best possible seat that can be
obtained through weight, balance, and friction;
and from it the upper part of the body may, without
affecting his stability, be bent forward or
back, or swayed from side to side, as circumstances
may require, while the lower parts of his legs are
free to apply the calf or the heel with rapidity and
precision to the sides of the horse. How much
of this bending or this swaying of the body may
sometimes be required is exhibited by the photograph
of the Italian cavalry officer who rides
down the face of a cliff, or by that of the rider
who makes a wheel, or pirouette volte, at a rapid
pace. From this seat the soldier may rise high
enough to give force to the blow of his sabre;
the hunter may send his feet home in the irons
without lengthening the leathers, and every horseman
will have the greatest security in the saddle
that his skill in riding makes possible.</p>

<p class="p1">There must be no rigidity; from that elastic
touch of the ball of the foot, throughout his whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
body, the man must be supple and unconstrained.
Stiffness in any part will destroy the essential
harmony, and prohibit grace and ease.</p>

<p>Dancing and calisthenics go far in producing
that suppleness, facility, and agility so necessary
for excellence in horsemanship, and gymnastic
exercises upon the back of the horse are of great
assistance in acquiring balance and firmness of
grip. Some of these more important mounted
exercises are now given, and others will occur
to the man who cares to take the trouble to ride
well. I may say here that I know men who have
been riding from twenty to thirty years and
through carelessness and want of instruction are
but little better horsemen than mere beginners.</p>

<p>A very quiet horse should be saddled and
bridled and taken to some retired place, if it be
a bit of soft ground there would be no harm, or
be brought into the riding-house where there are
no other horses except those being used for a like
purpose.</p>

<p>The man will then mount and take the position
of "the seat without stirrups," his arms hanging
down loosely. He should then, without
disturbing the position of the seat, and without
struggling, bend forward until one or the other
shoulder touches the crest of the horse, regaining
the erect position slowly and gently. He should
in a like manner lean backward, until his shoulders
rest upon the croup of the horse, and then rise
as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The rider will then lose his seat, to the right
or to the left, as far as he may without falling, and
regain the saddle by a twist of the body and buttocks
and grasp of the thighs, without taking any
assistance from his hands. This exercise is valuable
in giving the rider the power of regaining
his seat, should it be by chance disturbed, without
pulling on the mouth of the horse.</p>

<p>From the seat before described, the rider will
carry his right leg over the crest of the horse,
then he should turn to the left so that both legs
are hanging on the near side of the horse, then
carry the left leg over the croup of the horse,
which brings his face to the rear, then carry over
the right leg to the far side of the horse, and
finally resume the seat by carrying his left leg
over the crest of the animal. In a similar manner
the turn should be made to the right, and in
neither case may aid be sought from the hands.</p>

<p>None of these exercises are difficult; after
more than fifty years' work in the saddle I do
them with ease, and a boy or a young man should
find themselves perfect after a few trials. Beginners
should practise them daily, and no horseman
who hopes to keep up his suppleness in the
saddle should neglect them for any length of
time as long as he rides. It is not necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
be a contortionist, nor will it answer to be an
ossified freak.</p>

<p>I dare not say how old a man may be and yet
retain all of those powers which make him a skilful
horseman. I know many riders who are well
up in the "sixties," who do not appear to have
lost any of their adroitness. That master of the
art, De Bussigny, is no longer very young, although
no one would believe the fact on seeing
him on a horse. I saw James Newsome riding
and training when he was far past seventy. I
remember being present when that gallant gentleman,
Count Taubenheim, equerry to the late
king of Würtemberg, already past ninety years
of age, rode in a quadrille before the present
emperor of Germany and gained deserved applause
for his admirable performance.</p>

<p>We have inherited from the English many
undesirable prejudices, among them the belief
that no "foreigner" can sit a horse. In every
country of continental Europe the majority of
men who are accustomed to ride are thorough
horsemen, some of them of the highest distinction,
because upon the continent riding is looked
upon and practised as an art which requires
application. The English breed the best horses
in the world, they manage those in harness marvellously
well, and there are no bolder or more
determined horsemen; but it must be acknowledged
that there are riders in Italy, Germany,
France, and Austria who equal them in boldness
and determination and surpass the best of them
in dexterity and knowledge of the art. The literature
of the various countries bears out what has
been written above, for until very recently the
English works on horsemanship were crude beyond
belief, and any improvement that has taken
place is due to the influence of foreign authors.</p>

<p class="p1">In America there has been, until very recently,
but little interest in horsemanship except in some
of the Southern states, and among soldiers and
the few devoted to polo and hunting; but the
horse shows, now so general throughout the
country, have excited great interest in the horse;
the riding-schools offer intelligent instruction,
and between them there will be fostered, let us
hope, a taste and inclination for good horses and
riding. This subject will be treated at greater
length in the following chapter.</p>

<p>The German foot-soldier is very stiff in his
movements, at least on parade, and there is a
certain stiffness about the trooper that detracts
from his appearance in the eyes of the critic, but
his seat is firm, and he handles his horse with
precision. His officer is usually a very fine
horseman, riding boldly and easily and with a
knowledge of the niceties of the art. Steeplechasing
and racing are practised largely throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the German Empire; they are encouraged
by the authorities and are participated in by
nearly all of the younger army men. Every one
who has there witnessed these sports has seen
some magnificent examples of ready and skilful
horsemanship. I must confess to sharing the
favorable opinion of the late emperor regarding
the German lieutenant. How he finds time with
such conscientious devotion to his manifold
duties to make his frequent and splendid appearances
in public is marvellous. He is, perhaps, a
little haughty with strangers, and undoubtedly
more than a little arrogant with civilians, failings
due to his education, but he is devoted to his
profession, a high-minded gentleman, and brave
cavalier. No cavalry ever made a better record
than did that of Germany in the last war with
France.</p>

<p>In France, from a very early period, a widespread
interest was taken in systematic horsemanship
that has not abated, and both the military
and civil life furnish many excellent horsemen.
In the Bois, in the exhibitions on the Champs-Élysées,
at the races and steeplechases about
Paris, and elsewhere, one may see good riding
under the most favorable circumstances. The
troopers of the French army are less rigid in
their saddles than are the Germans, and they
move with a rapidity and precision that must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
make them a formidable force in the attack.
The French are now disposed to disavow their
obligations to Baucher, but the fact is that all
that is good in their systems was invented or
formulated by that master, although they did not
follow him through the useless refinements of
his later years, and all modern methods, military
or civil, are founded upon Baucher's method.
No country has furnished such instructors in the
art of horsemanship as did France in Pluvinel,
La Broue, Sollisel, Guerinière, Baucher, Raabe,
and D'Aure, or the equal of any one of
them.</p>

<p>While the average rider of Italy may not surpass
his brethren of other countries, the Italian
army of to-day furnishes the most daring and
the most skilful horsemen in Europe. Much of
this excellence is due to the instruction and
exercises of the military riding-school in Rome,
and the admiration which the feats of these
officers have gained, has aroused the emulation
of those in the other provinces of the empire,
and, it may be said, great interest among horsemen
throughout the world.</p>

<p>In considering the horsemanship of continental
Europe, where nearly everybody who rides is, or
has been, in the army, one's mind naturally turns
to the military; but this is not so of England
where the majority is with the civilians, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
we look upon the hunting-field, the steeplechase
course, the polo grounds, or the pleasant Row.</p>

<p>The British horseman is a sportsman, and a
good sportsman, for, although he does not often
have to submit to defeat, he takes it like a man
and is ready with equal mind for another trial.
His insular prepossessions have awakened so
much animosity in the minds of other nations
that they find it hard to be just to him; and after
all these years of reciprocities he is about as
greatly misunderstood by European nations as
they are by him. As a consequence, he jeers and
sneers at all foreigners, and they deny that he is
a fair-minded sportsman or a good horseman. I
am speaking now of the general public who form,
or at least express, national opinions, for it is
known that there is often good feeling between
those members of the various nations who meet
on the same social plane.</p>

<p class="p1">An English sportsman, at his best, is a bold,
strong, determined rider, and this can be said of
a greater proportion of British horsemen than of
those of any other country; but he despises all
refinements, and many things which upon the
continent are considered essentials; he looks
upon circus tricks as beneath his notice; the
consequence is that he falls behind in a field in
which he should be first. His primary object in
riding is to get across a difficult country, and do
it quickly, and he succeeds; he is encouraged by
his favorite authors, who know nothing beyond
this, to believe that nothing remains. I think
that the observer who has seen the sportsman
ride will be disappointed with the horsemanship
of British troopers; he will, I think, see that the
officers, as a rule, ride well and gracefully, but
that the men do not ride as skilfully as they
should, their instruction being turned over to
riding-masters who follow primitive regulations.
However, there can be no doubt that the British
soldier will always maintain that high reputation
for valor which even his enemies grant.</p>

<p class="pn center">AMERICAN HORSEMANSHIP&mdash;OUR CAVALRY</p>

<p class="pn p2">I have said that in this country until very
recent years comparatively little interest was taken
in riding except in some of the Southern states
and in the army. This was not because aptitude
for the exercise was confined to certain districts,
for the hunt, polo, and riding clubs, and the
horse shows, now so general throughout the continent,
are proving that everywhere our countrymen
have the ability to make good horsemen.
In the East there is, for example, Mr. Foxhall
Keene, who has a world-wide fame as a thorough
sportsman and a splendid rider; and although he
has perhaps no superior among these there are in
New York and Massachusetts riders of the very
first force.</p>

<p>When the subject of riding is broached, our
minds naturally turn to Kentucky.</p>

<p class="p1">From a long line of good horsemen the Kentuckian
inherits a love for the animal and a talent
for riding, and from childhood he is accustomed to
the saddle. His work in breeding and in training
has placed his country under a debt of gratitude.
Those who are well capable of judging say that
the sight of General Castleman upon a charger of
his own breeding is something to remember. Mr.
Charles Railey is unrivalled in showing the graceful
movements of a well-balanced saddle-horse,
and all of his family are skilled in the art of riding.
These names are mentioned because they are so
widely known, but there is no part of the state
in which one may not see that the words "Kentuckian"
and "horseman" are synonymous. The
writer has no intention of slighting Virginia, Missouri,
and Illinois, the first-named the cradle of
horsemanship in this country, the latter two rapidly
taking prominent places in the breeding and in
the training of the riding-horse, but the limits of
this work prevent full justice being done to all.</p>

<p>I have nothing but admiration for the skill and
daring of the riders of the Western plains, but
their bits, their saddles, and, I may say, their
horses are unsuited to the uses we are considering,
and we can give them only our applause.</p>

<p>Colonel Cody, who was a "pony express rider"
before the days of the transcontinental railway,
was a bold and tireless horseman. On one occasion,
his reliefs having been killed or driven off
by Indians, he went three hundred and twenty-two
miles in thirty-two hours of continuous riding.
He is still a strong and graceful horseman,
having adopted the military seat, and is one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the best known and most picturesque figures of
our day.</p>

<p>The mention of Indians reminds me that they
are the real American horsemen. My acquaintance
with the red man is mostly of rather a
vicarious character, somewhat similar to Mark
Twain's pedestrian excursions. My grandfather,
Lieutenant-colonel Richard Clough Anderson, 6th
Virginia Continental Line, went to the Falls of
the Ohio, now Louisville, Kentucky, in the year
1784, and was one of that band of pioneers who
upheld and advanced the border. Since then
there has been little or no time when some member
of the family, or close friend, has not been in
contact with the Indian. When the red man began
to break and ride the wild horse, it would
be difficult to say. The woodland and border
savages used horses stolen from the whites, but
Lewis and Clark found the Western tribes using
the mustang, broncho, cayuse, or whatever the
title of the free horse may be, as early as 1804.
Excepting the Comanches and some of the Sioux,
the Indians, I am told, were neither very bold nor
very skilful riders, although they managed their
horses with sufficient dexterity to make them dangerous
enemies, but they had no mercy upon their
beasts and no sentimental regard for them.</p>

<p class="p1">The story of the United States cavalry explains,
in brief, the remarkable efficiency it has
maintained in spite of the disadvantages with
which it has been burdened&mdash;single bridles,
short service, and changeable riding instructions.
Up to 1861 the corps consisted of but five regiments,
commanded by the most select body of
officers in any service, gentlemen who had passed
through the best military college in the world, or
who were especially fitted for the duty to which
they were assigned. Between the Civil War and
the recent war with Spain five more regiments
were added, which were soon assimilated through
tradition and example, and the still small body of
mounted men kept and augmented, during a most
trying period of great battles and severe Indian
campaigns, its splendid reputation. In 1891 five
more regiments were added, and these were
readily taken up by the ten existing organizations,
now forming a fair force which is a credit to our
army, and which should be changed only by
graduated increase, say with one or two regiments
armed with that unwieldy, but fear-provoking,
weapon, the lance.</p>

<p>Before undertaking the present chapter I went
to Fort Riley, Kansas, to visit the School of
Application for mounted service, to gain information
regarding our cavalry, and to obtain photographs
for the illustration of this book.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the weather proved so bad that
I could take advantage of but few of the opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
for using my camera, so kindly offered me
by Colonel Steevers, the commandant; but in the
short, infrequent periods of good light I procured
the pictures which adorn these pages, and otherwise
I saw much that was of great interest.</p>

<p>The school of equitation, to which branch I
gave my attention chiefly, is under the direction
of Captain W. C. Short, a splendid horseman, and
both his scholars and the senior officers spoke in
the highest praise of the good results which had
followed his instruction. When a regular, simple,
but complete method of horsemanship becomes
general throughout the mounted service, a cavalryman
may be made efficient in less than half the
time required by less finished systems which
may be varied with each change in the company
commander.</p>

<p class="p1">I saw a few of the graduates from the school
of equitation in such movements as a cavalryman
might be called upon to make, pirouettes, side
movements, etc., and also in jumping. The riding
was excellent, and the horses showed far
better training than is usually found in officers'
chargers. While at the fort, it so happened
that I saw but two troops mounted. One morning
Captain Rutherford's troop, of the Fourth
Cavalry, passed me in going out to target practice,
and I was greatly pleased with the appearance of
the men, as they bore themselves with easy, graceful,
but strong seats, the stirrup leathers two or
three holes shorter than in former days, and just
right to my way of thinking, while the neat service
uniform was a wonderful improvement over
the old blue blouse and baggy trousers,&mdash;as old
Pepys would have said, "a pretty sight." Later
in the day I saw a quick drill, trot and gallop,
of Troop K, Eighth Cavalry, under Lieutenant
George Williams. I was told that, owing to the
interruptions incident to target practice, the men
and horses were not in the best condition for this
work; but there was no occasion for adverse criticism,
and the performance compared most favorably
with similar movements I had witnessed
with "crack" companies of European cavalry.
On another occasion some of the men of Troop L,
Eighth Cavalry, under the direction of Lieutenant
Duncan Elliott, gave an exhibition of daring
horsemanship. "Roman standing races" upon
two horses, vaulting upon and over two and three
galloping horses, standing upon the bare back of
a horse while leaping the bar, and, finally, the
riding of horses which "bucked" violently, were
features of this entertainment, which was concluded
without an error or an awkward motion.
Visits to the farriery, to the school for veterinary
studies, to the pack-train, and to the targets
filled in the time pleasantly and profitably. On
the whole, one must be a very unobservant, unappreciative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
visitor who would not be impressed
with the great value of the School of Application,
not only in the branch upon which I have
touched, but in everything relating to the
mounted service.</p>

<p class="pibq">HOW TO RIDE&mdash;THE SNAFFLE-BRIDLE&mdash;THE WALK
AND THE TROT&mdash;SHYING&mdash;THE CUNNING OF THE
HORSE&mdash;SULKING&mdash;REARING&mdash;DEFEATING THE
HORSE</p>

<p class="pn p2">Among my earliest recollections are those of a
Shetlander, "Billy Button," upon which I used to
disport myself on the gravel footwalk in front of
our house. My children, also, have been accustomed
to horses from infancy. These youthful
experiences are doubtless useful in teaching confidence
and, what is of equal importance, discretion.
If he is not in terror of all such animals,
it is the inexperienced person who exhibits too
much boldness and places himself unnecessarily
at the heels of a horse or overrates his powers
of control. But a boy will never learn to <i>ride</i>
upon a diminutive pony or upon any dull, slow-moving
horse; from them he does not get the
seat that quick motions quickly give, and his
hand will be spoiled by the hard mouth or the
"no mouth" of a sluggish beast.</p>

<p>Eight or ten years of age is as early as children
should receive orderly lessons in horsemanship.
It is useless to give instructions before the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
is old enough to understand them or strong
enough to carry them out. Indeed, I think
that most riding masters would prefer taking an
active boy of sixteen or eighteen years of age who
had never been on a horse in place of one much
younger who had been riding at his own sweet
will. Aside from want of vigor, the latter
would almost certainly have faults difficult to
correct.</p>

<p>I advocate the use of the Shetland or other
small pony as an amusing and valuable toy for
very young children; but when they are old
enough to receive instruction in riding, the pony
should be devoted to harness, where he is really
useful and often ornamental, and something larger
should be procured for the rider.</p>

<p>A retired polo pony, or some quick but steady
animal of that type, is an admirable successor to
the Shetland for a child's riding. When I was a
boy we used to get ponies from the Indian country,
I think they were called Cherokees, that were
simply perfection&mdash;pretty, nimble, and free from
all vices. Mounted upon them, a number of boys
would together scamper over the hills, avoiding
the monotony of the roads, to try conclusions in
speed, in jumping logs, low fences, and such
obstacles, and in other exploits that gave firm
seats and confidence. Then, sometime in the
late '50's, Henri Franconi opened a riding-school
and initiated us in the manège, and we began to
break and train horses.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill164" id="ill164">164</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Girls should occasionally be placed upon a
cross-saddle until they reach the age of ten or
twelve years, so that they may learn the employment
of the aids; but there is no more ungraceful
position that a grown woman can take than to
mount a horse astride; she has a far firmer seat
in the side-saddle, and when she is a good rider
never shows to greater advantage.</p>

<p>Any man may learn to ride with safety and
comfort at any age as long as he has the necessary
activity; and there are many men of forty, or
even of fifty, who would be able to ward off old
age for a long time, and have a pleasurable, wholesome
exercise, by riding horses that do not require
too much skill in their management.</p>

<p>For one to excel in horsemanship, certain
physical qualifications and a rare gift, aptitude
for the art, are required. I have often heard
William Fritz of Stuttgart say at an early lesson,
"That boy will never make a rider," or, less
frequently, "Ah! here we have a good one;" for
that experienced teacher soon recognized the
possession of the necessary adroitness or the
want of it.</p>

<p>But even where one has every natural advantage,
he will never become a horseman without
some instruction in the general principles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
art. These have been formulated, after centuries
of experiment, and it is impossible that any one
should acquire a useful knowledge of them by his
unaided endeavors. The worst rider who ever
mounted a horse imitated other, and of course
better, horsemen when he essayed to get outside
of the animal; but he doubtless thought that he
was his own instructor, and it is the man of such
reasoning powers who refuses to learn. We
know that in the history of the world there was
but one "natural rider," the brother of the first
oyster-eater, who in the dawn of the quaternary
period rode his family dinner, a broken-down,
prehistoric horse, to his cave home. Since that
event riding has been an art handed down by
tradition and imitation.</p>

<p>The aptitude of which I speak is indicated by
suppleness of the body, deftness of hands and legs,
and the faculty of obtaining an understanding
with the horse. Rigidity in any part will prevent
one becoming a good horseman. The aids
(hands and heels) must be applied with celerity
and precision, and the rider must feel what the
horse is doing and what it purposes to do. All
of these things demand long and carefully conducted
practice, but their full acquirement is
denied to most men; otherwise we would have
more such masters as De Bussigny.</p>

<p>From long practice in applying the aids the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
thorough horseman can use hands and legs without
conscious thought, and he would often find
it difficult to say offhand what he had done
under certain conditions. His movements become
as impulsive as those of the skilled pianist,
who methodically touches thousands of keys
with such marvellous rapidity that it seems impossible
that his mind can even follow his fingers.</p>

<p>The trained horse under the trained rider
moves at the master's will; the two are one, it is
the centaur. The intent is one with the action,
there is no time for consideration, thought has
been expended in early practice and has produced
those instinctive motions of the man which
are always right and always instantly obeyed
instinctively.</p>

<p>From the first, it should be known that riding
is the production by the rider's heels of impulses
which are met, governed, and directed by his
hand. Therefore the secret of success in horsemanship
is <i>that the spur must always precede the
hand</i>, whether it be to advance, to turn, or to go
backward. If the hand is not given impulses, it
is powerless, and the horse is not under control.
Whenever the word "spur" is used, it indicates
such effect of the leg aid as the condition requires,
whether it be the pressure of the calf
against the side of the horse, the tap of the heel,
or the prick of the sharp rowel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The beginner should use the simple snaffle-bridle,
for it has a much wider range of effects
than the curb-bit, and with it he can do less
damage to the horse and to himself when he
hangs on to the reins to aid his seat or uses more
force than is requisite. The instructions contained
in this chapter, I should say, are primarily
intended for the behoof of the tyro, but they
would not be superfluous for ninety-nine hundredths
of those who fancy they can ride.</p>

<p>The general principles of horsemanship are so
few and so simple that any one should readily
master them; afterward it is a mere matter of
practice and aptitude. It is a matter of surprise
that so many men ride, and yet do not think it
worth while to investigate the principles of the
art which they think they follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The rider, having taken his position upon the
horse, as has been described, for the seat, he will
take a snaffle-rein in each hand, the loose ends
toward his thumbs and held by them, the reins
passing through the breadth of his hands, which
are held knuckles up, close together, to assist
each other, and take a gentle feeling upon the
mouth of the horse. He should then quietly close
his legs against the sides of the horse and draw
the reins until he has collected the forces of the
animal, so that it will be able to go forward in a
measured pace and not in the loose and disunited
condition that would ensue were it driven on
before it had been prepared. This collection
will be evidenced by the alertness of the impulses
and by the movements of its muscles, as the horse
arranges the bearers to take each its share of the
weight. To advance at a walk the rider will increase
the pressure of his legs, or give a gentle
tap of the whip behind the girth, until he produces
the necessary impulses, which should be met
by the hand in such a manner that the horse will
proceed in an evenly cadenced walk. The movements
of the horse are due to the changes of the
centre of gravity produced by the impulses, and
the legs make corresponding changes of position
in order that they may support the mass as
it passes over them in any direction. As the
violence and rapidity of the changes of the
centre of gravity increase, so does the speed and
also the changes in the positions of the legs as
they are required to give support. This is all
very simple, and the rider should know at the
start how the impulses he demands act, and how
they may be governed.</p>

<p>The lowest form of collection of the forces
in which the horse may move in a regularly
cadenced pace, say in the walk, the moderate
trot, and the hand-gallop (sometimes miscalled
the canter), is the state which we call "in hand."
When the horse hangs upon the bridle and shambles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
along, it is out of hand, and renewed exertion
should be called for from the hind quarters, which
should be met and measured by the bit. When
the animal proceeds in free and even strides, its
head fairly elevated, its face about perpendicular
to the ground, and there is a light, elastic tension
against the reins, it is "in hand," and between
heels and hand should be kept so.</p>

<p>If a horse is "out of hand," it is not only
careless in raising its feet, but the bearers are
not moved rapidly enough for the preservation
of the centre of gravity, and so the animal is
very apt to stumble and fall. When in hand,
a horse goes as safely as is possible for that
particular horse, action and strength being considered.</p>

<p>What has been recommended above will not
be accomplished perfectly when the rider mounts
a horse for the first time. It is the goal for which
he should strive, and when he has reached it, he
has made good progress in the art.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It is while riding at the walk that the rider
may best obtain the seat and that ease and
pliancy which is so greatly to be desired. It
also gives him a better opportunity of practising
the various applications of his hands and
heels than would be practicable in more vigorous
movements. A story is told of a certain
master of the art, who, in reply to the question
how long it would take for a man to acquire a
good seat, replied, "Fifteen years at the walk."
If the rider pays strict attention to every detail,
maintains, with occasional guarded relaxations,
his position, and studies the effects of his application
of the aids, a liberal deduction might be
made from the above estimate of the time
required to acquire proficiency in the most
important feature of horsemanship. It is true
that a man should, and probably will, learn something
nearly every time he mounts a horse, for
"art is long," but an apt pupil should become
a very good horseman, without confining himself
to the walk, in two or three years, and be able
to ride fairly in a much shorter time.</p>

<p>It is not to be understood that a proficient
should never let his horse go out of hand, for
occasionally it will be a relief to horse and man
to be free from all constraint; but this liberty
should never be given to a leg-weary animal
or upon rough or slippery ground, or in descending
steep slopes. The Italian riders, in taking
their horses down precipitous hillsides, put the
animals straight, the horses closely united.</p>

<p>In the walk the rider will proceed in straight
lines, in circles and curves of varying diameters,
and in turns to either hand. The pace should
be even and regular, and the impulses from the
croup kept up so that the horse will not become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
heavy in hand. The forehand will be kept light
and the jaw pliant by light tensions upon the
reins, with occasional vibrations made by a play
of the fingers upon the reins. A very little practice
will show what these vibrations should be.</p>

<p>In turning to the right the movement will be
directed by the right rein, its effects measured
and restrained by the left rein, while the outside or
left leg of the rider will give an increased pressure
against the side of the horse to keep the
croup from swaying out. The whole body of the
horse should conform to the arc of the path followed.
In making short turns, the horse should
first be collected a little more closely, and as soon
as the animal enters upon the new direction it
should be put straight and be ridden in exactly
the same form as it had before the turn was made.
The turn to the left will be made in the same
manner,&mdash;the left rein, guarded in its effects by
the right, demanding the turn, the right leg of
the rider keeping the croup upon the path.</p>

<p>In bringing the horse to a halt from the walk,
the rider should close his legs against the animal's
sides, lean back slightly, and raise the bridle-hand.
This will bring the horse to a stop in a finished
manner, with its hind legs under the mass, ready
to furnish impulses for further movements. The
tension upon the reins should then be relaxed
and the legs of the rider withdrawn.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It is a rule, without exception, that when one
rein or heel is applied, the other rein or heel must
be prepared to guard its effects from being answered
in too great a degree.</p>

<p>The walk is a pace of four beats, one foot being
planted after another at regular intervals. If the
right fore foot comes to the ground first, it is followed
by the left hind foot, then the left fore foot
is planted, and lastly the right hind foot. Then
a new stride begins. In every stride the mass is
borne by two legs or by three legs; just before a
fore foot is planted, its diagonally disposed hind
foot leaves the ground; at that moment the two
legs bear the weight; when the fore foot is planted,
three legs bear the weight. By stride we mean
the movement that covers the ground from the
time a certain foot comes to the ground until it
is again planted. Through moment photography
we have gained a knowledge, not only in every
phase of the ordinary paces of the horse, but practically
of every movement the animal is capable
of making; and through the same medium I was
able to explain, for the first time, the gallop
changes, which very important movement was
previously not understood, and was procured only
by tentative experiments with each horse trained
to make it.</p>

<p>When, the horse having been in the walk, the
speed is increased, a different movement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
legs must take place to keep the bearers under
the centre of gravity, and the diagonally disposed
hind leg acts in unison with a fore leg, when we
have a pace in which the horse springs from one
pair of legs to the other, which gives the trot. In
the trot we have a gait of two beats, as the horse
takes the weight upon the right (or left) fore leg,
and the left (or right) hind leg after each spring,
going into the air as each pair of bearers leaves
the ground.</p>

<p>The horse should be ridden in the trot in
exactly the same manner as in the walk, except
that in the turns the horse should be more closely
united between hand and heels, particularly as the
rate of speed is increased. As far as the rapidity
of the movement will permit, the state of collection
described as "in hand" should be observed.
In trotting or in galloping at great speed a horse
must extend itself too much to permit any such
condition of its forces as that indicated; but if at
sharp turns the flying horse is not somewhat
brought together, so that it may have the bearers
under the centre of gravity, as the mass leans inward,
a fall will probably result, almost certainly
if the horse be galloping with the outside legs
taking the advanced strides.</p>

<p class="p1">But the horse should not be put into the gallop
until it has been drilled in the double bridle,
and has been taught the various forms of collection
which prepare it for that pace; and we shall
hope that even the rapid trot will not be undertaken
by the beginner until he is quite sure of
himself at lower rates of speed, or he will acquire
faults difficult to remedy. When an indifferent
rider is in the habit of speeding a horse in the
trot, he almost invariably takes his weight upon
his spine, arches the body, holds his arms stiffly
forward, loosens his knee contacts, and has about
the same security in the saddle that a bag of
meal laid upon it would have.</p>

<p>To reduce the speed in the trot or to bring
the horse to a halt from that pace, the rider
should close his legs against the sides of the
horse, lean back slightly, and, raising the hand,
increase the tension upon the reins until the
animal answers his demands by reduced speed.
Then the increased tension upon the reins is
relieved, and the legs of the rider withdrawn from
the horse, and the slower trot having been obtained,
the halt may be made from it; in the
latter case the animal should be first put into
the walk, and then brought to a stop as before
described.</p>

<p>Nearly every horse will shy if "a bit above
himself" from want of work, and many horses,
otherwise quiet, shy habitually at some favorite
object, either flying paper, a high wagon, an
automobile, or some such thing. If the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the horse be turned away from that which offends
it, the animal may not only be made to pass it,
but it will not be nearly so apt to jump down
an embankment or run into some other danger,
in its efforts to avoid that which caused its fright
or pretended fright.</p>

<p>Horses show much cunning in alarming a
timid rider, and such an unfortunate is unmasked
at once. Some horses will endeavor to rub a
rider's knees against a wall, when they may readily
be foiled by having the head drawn into the
wall; others will misbehave on slippery pavement;
others will refuse to go in desired directions.
Indeed, their mischievous tricks are so
various that it is impossible to name them. It
is seldom that they even try these performances
with a determined horseman, and I have heard
trainers say of horses sent to them to be cured of
vices, that they could find nothing wrong with
the animals.</p>

<p>If a horse sulks and refuses to move, sticking
out its nose stiffly and spreading its legs as if to
brace itself against being forced forward, the
rider should not resort to punishment, as it is
probable that the animal would retaliate by violent
misconduct. If the animal can be induced
to move its croup to the right or left, the rigidity
will disappear and the forward progress be
obtained. I have known cases where the horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
under such a condition, has been made to go forward
by being ridden into by another horseman.</p>

<p>A horse rears, either because there is too
severe a pull upon the bit, or because it is in
terror at something which faces it unexpectedly,
or through an acquired vice. When a horse is
about to rear through vice, it almost always
"drops the bit" (that is, the rider finds there is
suddenly no tension upon the reins), and then
thrusts its head in air and tries to rise upon its
hind legs. If the rider sends in one of the spurs
before the horse is balanced upon its haunches,
it will induce a movement of the hind legs which
will bring the forehand down, and the horse
should then be pushed forward. Often a horse
which is not very keen about it will make two or
three weak essays before it goes quite up, and
just as it makes one of these little rises the prick
of the spur is very effective in bringing the animal
down and in a position that prevents rearing
until it is again prepared, before which it should
be driven along. But if the horse has already
risen, the rider must loosen the reins and lean
forward; and as soon as the forehand comes
down, he should drive the horse forward in any
pace or action that it will take, to procure better
regulated movements later. If the rider finds
by a sinking of the croup that a rearing horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
is falling backward, he should release his feet
from the stirrups, seize the mane and pommel,
drop from the saddle, and throw himself away
from the animal as it topples over. I have cured
a horse, apparently confirmed in this vice of
throwing itself backward, by a thorough course
of suppling; and it was afterwards ridden in
various games and exercises which involved the
pirouette, but the reformed animal never attempted
to rise higher than was demanded.
Whether the horse falls back intentionally or
not I cannot say. But horses that have a habit
of rearing so that they fall over are not rare.
In the far West those that fight the air are called
sunfishers, and none are more resolute or more
dangerous. I read somewhere recently that if
a horse kept its fore legs bent and down, it would
not fall over, but that when its fore legs were
extended upward and fought the air, it would
come over on its back. I have frequently seen
rearing horses in both poses which did not fall
and which had no intention of falling, and I
have had a horse throw itself over without giving
me the preliminary notice of extending its
fore legs in air. The elder Henri Franconi's
Johnster and Bayard, and Miss Emma Lake's
Bonnie Scotland, were well-known examples of
horses which reared safely with extended fore
legs; the other mode is not uncommon, but the
horse does not usually rise to a dangerous height
while the knees are bent.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Should a horse decline to leave its companions
or to go in a certain direction, the rider should
turn it around sharply three or four times upon
the side in which he finds least resistance, when
the animal becomes so confused that it may be
ridden wherever the man chooses. This in Germany
is called "rolling up," and is often practised
in the cavalry, where every horse must be
disciplined to leave the ranks singly&mdash;a very
difficult thing to obtain in any other manner.</p>

<p>I have never seen the time when a safely
trained horse of good disposition could not be
found after a little search; and it is very foolish
for any one but an expert or a professional horseman
to mount a wicked brute. A really vicious
horse will try the nerve of any man, but fortunately
they are not frequently met outside of the
ranches, and they become rarer as time goes on.
Yet all of us have seen the young person of
limited experience, and even less skill, who
would boast of being able to ride anything and
was desirous of dominating a bad horse.</p>

<p>Every horse that is lively enough to make a
safe and agile riding animal will become fresh
and disorderly if it does not get work enough. If
it be not ridden sufficiently, it should be longed
on the cavesson rein, or turned into a paddock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
The most careful riding master I have ever
known&mdash;and in my wanderings I have kept my
horses in more than a score of riding-schools&mdash;was
accustomed to turn his fresh horses, one by
one, for a little time into the "ring," and, after
some play, the horses would be perfectly quiet
for the most timid and inexperienced pupil.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pn center">WHAT TRAINING WILL DO FOR A HORSE&mdash;THE
FORMS OF COLLECTION</p>

<p class="pn p2">A great deal of the neglect in training horses
properly is due to the fact that most people&mdash;by
very far the greater number&mdash;are deterred by
the imaginary difficulties presented by the rules
and by the practice involved, and in consequence
there is not one horse in a thousand that is even
agreeable to ride.</p>

<p>The fact is, there is no more difficulty in acquiring
a knowledge of the rules of training than
of the first three numbers of the multiplication
table; and the practice of them is far more pleasant
and a great deal easier than the daily labor
of buttoning one's boots.</p>

<p>Owing to the changes in the centre of gravity,
due to the rider's weight and position, the normal,
well-formed horse must be given an artificial carriage
to enable it to bear the man in easy, light,
and cadenced paces. Whether the rider is aware
of the fact or not, this correction always takes
place, usually through tentative and chance-directed
efforts, before the animal becomes safe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
pleasant to ride. Horses that are ill-formed or
awkward may be so greatly improved in bearing
and action, that their defects are nullified to such
an extent that many apparently hopeless cases
may be made very satisfactory riding animals.
All horses are benefited in carriage, in disposition,
and in form by a course of schooling.</p>

<p>What can be done to correct physical defects
in a horse by a short term of schooling would
appear incredible to one not initiated in the art.
Weak parts may be strengthened, strong muscles
may be developed from those that are deficient,
poor action may be improved, and the general
appearance and motions of any animal changed
for the better by simple exercises, which at the
same time establish absolute discipline.</p>

<p>These changes are procured from suppling
the horse. By suppling is meant <i>overcoming
the resistances of the horse, whether they be active
or passive, intentional or physical, so that
all opposition and rigidity are removed, and
the animal becomes obedient and pliant in every
part</i>.</p>

<p>If the reader will think of the forehand (controlled
by the reins), and the hind quarters (controlled
by his heels), as two parts to be brought
to act together, so balanced that neither extremity
is embarrassed, and the point of union and balance,
the centre of gravity, is directly under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
rider, he will see how the horse may be made to
move lightly and easily.</p>

<p>Suppose the horse be low in the forehand and
goes too much on the shoulders when in action,&mdash;a
miserable condition of affairs. The defects
suggest the remedies. The hind legs will be
carried under the body to depress the croup, the
forehand will be raised and its forces carried to
the rear, until the weight and forces are brought
to the desired point of union and balance.</p>

<p>Or, let us take the case of a horse high and
strong in the forehand, but low and weak in the
hind quarters. Here the hind legs should be
brought up to that point where, without lowering
the croup, they have the greatest impulsive power,
and the forces of the forehand should be carried
back only far enough to balance these inferior
forces of the rear. Of course, in this case particular
attention should be paid to strengthening
the loins and hind quarters by the exercises hereafter
to be explained.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the horse "goes upon its shoulders"
and hangs upon the hand, the forces of the
croup are too strong for the forehand, and the
latter part should be elevated while the hind legs
should be carried under the body of the horse to
lessen their effect sufficiently to produce balance
in the extremities. But if there be feeble and
constrained action in the hind legs, the forehand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
is too high and strong, and the centre of gravity
too far to the rear, and this state must be
remedied.</p>

<p>The power to effect the conditions described
will be obtained by subduing all resistances; the
jaw of the horse, and all those parts in front of
the rider, will be made pliant and obedient to the
reins; the hind quarters will be dominated by the
rider's heels.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter the condition of collection
known as "in hand," the lowest form in
which smooth, even, safe, and regular paces may
be made, was described for the walk and the
trot. Unless some closer form of collection is
employed for one or another reason, the ordinary
gallop of three beats or "hand gallop" should
always be performed "in hand"; that is, there
should be such a collection of the forces that the
pace is even, steady, and cadenced, no undue
weight upon the shoulders, the crest curved, the
face of the horse about perpendicular to the
ground, the jaw supple, and as a matter of course
the horse always under complete control. The
trainer should ever bear in mind that whenever
there is any disorder or misconduct the earlier
lesson should be reverted to, until the horse is
<i>absolutely obedient</i> under all conditions. When
the horse has been habituated to maintain the
state of collection known as "in hand," in the walk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
trot, and gallop, it should be taught the closer
forms of union.</p>

<p>From time to time the rider should, while in a
slow but nimble trot, bring the horse to closer
forms of collection, the heels maintaining the
impulses, the hand with vibratory plays upon the
reins, keeping the forehand light and lithe. As
the forces are more nearly brought to a point of
union and balance under the rider, the speed will
decrease, and when these forces of the extremities
are absolutely united and balanced for a moment,
the half-halt will be produced, when the horse is
prepared for a movement in any direction. But
this <i>half-halt</i> may be held for only a moment,
while the muscles are in play, and at least one
leg is flexed, or the horse will become heavy, the
feet will come to the ground, and a complete halt
will ensue, when the tension upon the reins
should be eased and the heels be withdrawn from
the sides of the horse. When the forces of the
extremities of the trotting-horse are as closely
united as is compatible with a forward movement,
any increased impulses will be turned into height
of action under the body, and the animal will
seem to grow under the rider, as with curved
crest, in which the quivering muscles prove the
pliancy of the mass, the horse goes from one pair
of diagonally disposed legs to the other in a slow,
measured, brilliant trot&mdash;the most beautiful effect
possible to obtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>These closer forms of collection may be produced
in a very slow gallop in exactly the same
manner as in the slow trot; and the gallop in this
case becomes one of four beats as each leg follows
the other in regular intervals. The <i>half-halt</i> may,
and should in practice, be made from the slow gallop
by a very close collection, the union and balance
of the forces, and the gallop be renewed in some
form immediately, before the horse becomes
heavy and the full halt ensues. The half-halt in
the gallop has a variety of important uses, such as
a preliminary step for making the gallop change,
for making the gallop wheels, etc.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pn center">THE SPUR</p>

<p class="pn p2">Baucher says, somewhere, that to give an
indifferent horseman the spur is as bad as to give
a razor into the hands of a monkey. There is
not one rider in ten thousand who knows how to
give the sharp rowel, or is aware of its true uses.
Improperly and too frequently applied, the spur
makes the horse sluggish and never answers its
real and full significance. The rider's leg and
heel, or the sharp rowel when necessary&mdash;a rare
occasion&mdash;gives the horseman control over the
impulses which produce action, and over all the
movements of the hind quarters. The sharp
rowel, indeed any form of the leg aid, should
never be given with a kick or a thrust. The
lower part of the rider's leg should be carried
back until the scratch or prick can be given by
the elevation of the heel. To enable the rider to
do this with precision requires much practice in
the use of the leg below the knee, so that even in
violent movements he may be able to give just
the effect the occasion requires. The lower leg
of the rider demands the forward movement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
demands the movement to the rear, and that to
either side, and also the collections, including the
half-halt and the finished halt These results
cannot be produced properly by a thoughtless or
an unskilful use of an aid, which should always
be applied at the right moment, with the right
touch, and in the right place.</p>

<p>For the comfort, not to speak of the safety, of
its rider, every horse should be taught to bear the
prick of the spur without violent outbursts; and
this is more important for the poor horseman
than for him who is skilful. The most nervous
animal may be taught to bear the application of
the rowel with complacency, and without such
discipline it would be impossible to make the
gallop changes, and many other movements directed
by the spur, smoothly and uniformly. On
some occasion when the horse is going quietly,
it having previously been accustomed to the
pressure of the rider's legs and to that of the
sides of his heels, the rider should carry a leg
close to the flank of the horse and give a scratch
with the rowel just behind the girths, as he is
making a turn or demanding a bend of the croup.
The animal should be quieted by caresses after
this attack, and then the spur should be applied
to the other side in the same way, and the horse
be made much of. In time both spurs should
be used in bringing the horse to a halt The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
finished horseman can demand the most perfect
repose from the most spirited horse by the use of
this instrument. Used as directed, the animal
will not only be steady when the scratch is given,
but also quick and ready in obedience to the
milder forms of the leg aid, the pressure of the
leg or of the side of the heel, and it will be rarely
the case that the more severe form will be necessary.
In riding my trained horses the rowels are
removed from the spurs; and I have had horses
that were always free and lively in their actions
and perfect in manège movements that had not
felt the sharp spur for many years. Some horses
will "shut up" and refuse to increase their speed
when punished with the spur; and in all cases its
severe attacks are as useless as they are cruel.</p>

<p>To produce the impulses for movements forward
or to the rear, this aid should be applied
immediately behind the girths. There is an old
French saying that a torn girth shows good
horsemanship. To bend the croup, as in the
side movements upon two paths and in the gallop
changes, the spur should take touch on the flank
four or five inches behind the girths.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pn center">SOME WORK ON FOOT&mdash;THE SUPPLING</p>

<p class="pn p2">It has been said that the term "suppling" indicates
the vanquishing of all the resistance offered
by the horse, whether voluntary or involuntary.
The control which this gives over the actions of
the animal is produced by cultivating its instinctive
yieldings to the application of the bit and
spur until obedience becomes a natural impulse
and the animal does not dream of opposition.
The lessons are given in such a manner that
there are no struggles against restraint, no fears
are caused, and there are no punishments to
arouse animosity. Indeed, any rough treatment
will defeat the object of the trainer, who requires
nothing more than patience to insure his success.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill205a" id="ill205a">205a</a></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">For example, when the bit comes against the
horse's mouth, the first impulse is to avoid the
pressure and to yield the jaw; the second impulse
is to resist the confinement. By the cultivation
of the first instinctive yielding of the jaws the
trainer obtains absolute control over the mouth of
the horse, and by successive exercises, properly
arranged, over the whole of those parts in front
of the saddle. In like manner, when the leg or
heel of the rider is applied to the flank of the
horse, its first impulse is to move forward the
hind leg of the side attacked, and bend the croup
over to the other side; the second impulse will
be to come against the leg or heel in resistance.
By cultivating the first impulse on the application
of the spur the rider obtains control over all
those parts of the horse behind the saddle. So, between
hand and heels, the man may obtain perfect,
because instinctive, obedience from the trained animal.
Beyond keeping on friendly terms with the
horse, and the avoidance of everything that would
start its fears, no trust is to be placed in the animal's
voluntary dutifulness, for what is desired
may be demanded, and the good-will of a horse is
a very slender reed upon which to lean. My
horses know my footsteps, and show recognition
of my voice, but I have never permitted their
blandishments to lead me to trust one of them
beyond control without finding cause for regrets
sooner or later.</p>

<p>Much of the work in suppling the horse can
be done far more quickly with the trainer on foot
than from the saddle. Indeed, almost all the
education of a riding-horse might be carried on
without the trainer mounting at all, and that very
expeditiously; the finishing lessons under the
saddle would be required to transfer the indications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of the whip to the rider's heels. The handling
that would be given by the trainer on foot
would prepare the horse for anything that might
follow, and I have always found that the longer
the horse was worked in hand, the better were
the results. That is, if the horse be longed carefully;
be driven before the trainer in a long pair
of reins attached to a snaffle-bridle; be taught to
yield the jaw, the head, and the neck to the bits;
and be made to bend the croup and to bring the
hind legs under the body at the application of the
whip, there will be very little left to do when
the man mounts.</p>

<p>I shall now describe the least amount of work
that the trainer should perform on foot, as few
men will have the patience to carry the system
farther; but as the principles are always the same
any one who desires to try the experiment may
readily carry on the training in hand to its utmost
limit.</p>

</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">When the young horse&mdash;or any horse, for that
matter&mdash;is going well in the snaffle-bridle, the
animal should be given daily lessons in the
double bridle (curb and snaffle) in the following
manner: the curb-chain being removed for the
early lessons, the trainer should stand at the
head of the horse on the right, or off, side, and
take the right snaffle-rein in his right hand, while
the left hand grasps the two curb-reins at equal
lengths under the chin of the horse a few inches
from the bit. Then, extending his right arm away
from the nose of the horse and drawing the curb-reins
toward the chest of the animal, he will, with
just so much force as is necessary, induce the
horse to open the mouth and relax the lower jaw,
the head being held up by the snaffle-rein. As
soon as this is accomplished the tensions upon
the reins should be released and the horse rewarded
by caresses. The snaffle must keep the
head of the horse at the proper height, for the
tendency of the curb is to depress the head, and
the face of the horse should be kept about vertical
to the ground, certainly not any nearer the chest.
From time to time the trainer will release the
tension upon the snaffle-rein and draw the curb-reins,
as before, in gentle vibrations toward the
neck of the horse to test the progress of his work.
When the horse curls the upper lip, and the reins
always find nothing more than a light, elastic feeling
upon the lower jaw, the crest being curved
and the face held perpendicularly to the ground,
the man will know that the object of his work
has been accomplished, and it remains for him to
maintain this condition by constant practice until
it becomes habitual. If at any time the jaw
becomes rigid, or there is any resistance, a return
should be made to the exercises with the two
bits, as in the beginning. It is a rule observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
by all trainers that when a horse does not perform
perfectly that which is desired, to "go back
to number one," the first lesson.</p>

<p>The same work should be done with the trainer
standing on the left side of the horse, when his
left hand will hold the left snaffle-rein, his right
the curb-reins. These exercises, and those which
follow, should be given at least once every day,
twice or thrice will be better, and each exercise
should be followed no longer than for five minutes,
so that the horse may not be fatigued or annoyed
by the monotony.</p>

<p>Standing at the head of the horse, on the right
side, the trainer should take a rein of the curb-bit
in each hand, near the branches, and turning the
bit in the mouth of the horse, right branch forward,
bend the animal's head toward the left; at
first making a slight turn only, and by steps increasing
the bend until the face of the horse looks
to the rear. As soon as the head of the horse is
bent sufficiently to satisfy the trainer, he should
take equal tensions upon the bit, straighten it in
the mouth of the horse, and by gentle vibrations
induce the horse to yield the lower jaw so that
the reins shall find no more than an elastic feeling
upon that part as the face is turned to the
rear. The horse must never be allowed to bring
its head straight after this bend has been demanded,
but the trainer should quietly bring it
back into the normal position by means of the
reins. In a similar manner the head of the horse
should be bent to the right, the trainer standing
at the head of the horse on the left side. After
the horse has been habituated to bend the head
by means of the curb-bit to the right and to the
left, its face perpendicular to the ground and its
jaw pliant, it will be made to do the same by the
snaffle, the reins of that bit held as were those of
the curb-bit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">These lessons, in addition to those recommended
in Chapter II., will give the man complete
control over the forehand of the horse,
making the mouth light and compliant, and
developing and suppling the muscles of the
neck greatly to the improvement of the horse in
grace and in appearance.</p>

<p>Two very simple exercises will give control of
the hind quarters, when the completion of the
education of the horse will be a mere matter of
repetition and riding, as the discipline necessary
for demanding instant and exact obedience will
have been put in train.</p>

<p>To make the horse carry its hind legs under
the body, the man should stand on its left side
facing the saddle; then, taking the snaffle-reins
held under the chin of the horse at equal lengths
in his left hand, he should give some light taps
of a slender whip upon the animal's croup, preventing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
a forward movement by a tension upon
the snaffle-reins. At first the trainer should be
satisfied when the horse brings its hind feet forward
a few inches, but in time the animal should
by gradual steps be induced to carry its hind legs
so far under the mass that the four feet might
stand upon a handkerchief. To transfer the indications
of the whip to the heels, the rider should
mount, and, as he taps the horse on the rump with
the whip held behind his back, he should apply
his heels to the animal's sides until the hind legs
are carried forward sufficiently to satisfy his demands,
while a forward movement is prohibited
by a tension upon the snaffle-reins held in the
left hand. Gradually the employment of the whip
should cease and the horse be made to carry the
hind legs under the mass to any extent by the
pressure of the rider's heels. After the horse has
carried its hind legs under the mass, the man
should release the tension upon the reins, and by
permitting the forehand to advance, let the animal
take a natural position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">To make the horse carry the croup around the
forehand, the trainer should stand at the left side
of the horse, facing the saddle, with his left hand
he should take a grasp of the snaffle-reins under
the chin of the horse and bend the head slightly
away from him, and with the whip he should give
a light tap or taps on the side of the horse just
behind the girth. When the horse makes one
step with the croup away from the man, the forehand
held in place by the snaffle-reins, the whip
taps should cease, and the horse be rewarded
by caresses. Another step from the croup will
then be demanded, and step by step the croup
will be carried to the right completely about the
stationary forehand, the left fore leg acting as the
pivot, the right fore leg being brought forward to
conform to the movement by light taps of the
whip, the head of the horse bent toward the advancing
croup. The horse must not be permitted
to volunteer a step, but every step should be made
on the demand of the trainer.</p>

<p>In the same manner the horse should be made
to carry the croup to the left about the right fore
leg as the pivot, the trainer holding the snaffle-reins
in the right hand, the whip in the left, and
standing on the right side of the horse.</p>

<p>It will be well for the rider to mount the horse
in place, at this stage, and to conduct the suppling
and bending exercises just described, from the
saddle. That is, from the saddle he should bend
the head of the horse to either hand, first with
the curb-bit and then with the snaffle-bit, bringing
the head back to the normal position by
means of the reins; he should elevate the head,
and then by dropping the hand and playing with
the reins bring the face of the horse vertical to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the ground, with the jaw pliant in answer to
either bit; he should induce the horse to carry
the croup about the forehand to either side at
the application of his heel, enforced, if necessary,
by the whip held behind the rider's back, the
outer fore leg acting as pivot; and, finally and
frequently between the pressure of his legs and
gentle vibrations of the reins, he should unite
and balance the forces of the horse so that by the
working of the muscles under him, as the horse
arranges the bearers, he may know that the
animal is ready to move in hand.</p>

<p class="pibq">THE CURB-AND-SNAFFLE BRIDLE&mdash;GUIDING BY THE
REIN AGAINST THE NECK&mdash;CROUP ABOUT FOREHAND&mdash;UPON
TWO PATHS</p>

<p class="pn p2">If but one bit is used in riding, it should be
the snaffle, for it has a much wider range of
effects than the curb-bit, and the latter, when
employed alone, tends to lower the head of the
horse, and has other defects. It is better, however,
to have both bits, as together they answer
every requirement. With the snaffle the rider
may raise or depress the forehand, freshen and
relieve the mouth of the horse occasionally from
the restraint of the curb-bit, and counteract the
defective action of the latter, prepare the horse
for obedience to the indications of the more
severe mouthpiece, and give many other results
which will show themselves in practice. The
curb-bit gives more power to restrain the horse,
applies the pressure of the mouthpiece upon the
proper place, which the snaffle does not always
do, and by it the rider may more readily keep
the nose of the horse down so that the face
of the animal shall be vertical and thereby insure
the right power upon the right place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>With trained horses I seldom draw the curb-reins,
for the animals are so drilled and so sensitive
that the snaffle is nearly always sufficient
but the curb-bit is ever ready to enforce its peculiar
powers should there be failure on the part of
the snaffle, as, for example, where the horse throws
forward its nose so that the snaffle takes a bearing
in the corners of the mouth and so loses
much of its power.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the curb-bit is used in riding, while
the snaffle-reins lie slack, to be brought into play
when necessary; and most horses, and most riders,
require the curb-bit.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The man, having mounted, will take in his left
hand the reins of the curb-bit divided by the little
finger, the reins of the snaffle divided by the long
finger, the loose ends of both pairs of reins carried
through his hand and held by the thumb against
the forefinger, and draw the curb-reins until he
can feel the mouth of the horse. The right hand
will be kept on the loose ends of the reins behind
the left, but when it is called upon to assist the
bridle-hand it will act upon the reins in front of
the left hand, except in shortening the reins, when
it will draw them through the bridle-hand from
behind. Then, closing his legs against the animal's
sides, the rider should make gentle vibrations
of the curb-reins by a play of his fingers
until the pliant jaw and the working of the
muscles under him show that the horse is ready
to move in hand. In this form of collection he
should go forward in the walk. To turn to the
right he should bend the head of the horse with
the right snaffle-rein caught in his right hand, and
carry the left hand in which are the curb-reins
over to the right until the outer rein comes against
the neck of the horse. When the turn is begun,
he should drop the snaffle-rein, and when the new
direction is entered upon, he should bring the
bridle-hand in front of him, so that there shall be
equal tensions upon both curb-reins, and resume
a direct path. In the same manner the turn to
the left side should be inaugurated by the left
snaffle-rein, and the bridle-hand will be carried
over to the left until the right curb-rein is brought
against the right side of the neck of the horse.
This use of the curb-reins is called the indirect
indications of the bit. On straight lines the
bridle-hand should be held just above the pommel
of the saddle, the thumb uppermost and
pointing toward the horse's ears. No great
movement of the bridle-hand should be made in
demanding the turn; when carried over to the
right, the thumb should point toward the rider's
right shoulder; when carried over to the left, the
thumb should point toward the ground over the
left shoulder of the horse. By observing these
directions the rein may be brought against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
neck of the horse to give the indirect indications of
the bit without too great movement of the bridle-hand.
Gradually the employment of the direct
snaffle-rein to inaugurate the turn will be dispensed
with, and the change of direction will be
made by the curb-reins only as they are brought
against the neck of the horse.</p>

<p>In the walk and in the slow trot the horse
should be ridden in hand on straight paths and
in circles of varying diameters to accustom the
horse to that form of collection in the curb-bit;
and from time to time closer forms of collection
should be demanded, first in the walk and then
in the trot, until the half-halt may be produced
and the advance be again made before the horse
grows heavy. Whatever the form of collection,
the jaw of the horse must be kept pliant and the
forces of the two extremities be kept balanced.
If the horse hangs upon the reins, its hind legs
must be brought under the mass to lighten the
forehand, and every movement should be light,
even, and regular.</p>

<p>It is poor policy to put the horse into the
gallop before its education has been brought to
the point described in the preceding pages. It
is highly important that the horse should be
taught a perfectly controlled gallop, one in
which every form of collection may be observed
and in which the rider may demand the lead
with either side and the changes of lead with
precision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The croup about the forehand, or reversed
pirouette, prepares the horse for the movements
on two paths, for wheels in the gallop, for the
pirouette volte, and for the gallop changes, all
of which are requisite in a thoroughly trained
saddle-horse, when the rider aspires to have mastery
over every movement of the animal.</p>

<p>To make the horse perform the reversed pirouette,
the rider should bring it in hand in place.
Then, bending its head slightly to one side, say
the right, he should apply his left leg to the
flank and make the horse carry the croup to the
right, about the left fore leg as a pivot, the bridle-hand
keeping the forehand in place, the heel of
the rider demanding each step, the right leg of
the rider controlling the effects of his left leg.
In croup about forehand to the left, the head of
the horse should be bent slightly to the left, the
right fore leg of the horse acts as pivot, while the
rider's right leg induces the hind quarters to be
carried to the left around the turning-point.</p>

<p>In the work upon two paths the body of the
horse should be placed diagonally across the line
of progress, the forehand slightly in advance of
the croup, the head of the horse bent in the direction
of the movement. In going to the right, the
head of the horse will be bent to the right and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
forehand be led along one path, while the rider's
heels carry the croup along a parallel path, the
effects of the acting or left heel being measured
and controlled by the rider's right heel, the forehand
about two feet in advance of the croup. In
passing upon two paths to the left, the head of
the horse will be bent to the left, the forehand
being led to the left, and the rider's right leg, its
effects measured by the left, will carry the croup
upon a parallel path, so that the body of the horse
shall be diagonally disposed across the line of
progress.</p>

<p>In coming to a turn or on a circle, the croup
will be slightly retarded, so that the diagonal position
shall be observed everywhere on the arc
or the circumference, if the forehand be following
the longer outer path. But if in turns or circles
the croup be following the outer longer path, the
forehand will be retarded so that everywhere on
the arc or the circumference the diagonal position
of the mass shall be observed.</p>

<p>The horse should be ridden on two paths in
straight lines, in turns, and in large and small
circles, sometimes the forehand on the outer circumferences,
sometimes the croup following the
longer paths, in the walk, in the slow trot, and in
the united trot.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pibq">THE GALLOP, AND THE GALLOP CHANGE&mdash;WHEEL
IN THE GALLOP&mdash;PIROUETTE TURN&mdash;HALT IN
THE GALLOP</p>


<p class="pn p2">Until the publication of "The Horse in
Motion," many of the movements of the horse
were but little understood, and of these the gallop
was prominent by reason of its importance.
In these days, thanks to the quick eye of the
camera, there is no action which the horse is
capable of making that may not be clearly shown
in every phase.</p>

<p>There are several forms of the gallop, but the
general principles are the same in all, the variations
depending upon the speed and the state of
collection of the horse.</p>

<p>In the hand-gallop of three beats the horse goes
into air from a fore leg used as a leaping-pole; it
then brings to the ground the diagonally disposed
hind leg; the other hind leg and its diagonal fore
leg are then planted so nearly together that the
hoofs give the sound of but one beat; then the
first acting fore leg comes to the ground from
which the horse again goes into air in a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
stride. The horse is said "to lead" with the legs
which are advanced in each stride; if the horse
goes into air from the right fore leg, it is in <i>gallop
right</i>, as the fore and hind legs of that side are
advanced beyond the fore and hind legs of the
other side. If the horse goes into air from the
left fore leg, it will be in <i>gallop left</i>.</p>

<p>In the full-gallop, or racing pace, the secondly
planted hind leg is brought to the ground an
appreciable time before its diagonally disposed
fore leg, and we have a pace of four beats.</p>

<p>The canter, or lope, is a pace of feeble action
and of low form of collection in which the diagonal
fore leg is brought to the ground before the
second hind leg is planted.</p>

<p>In the school-gallop, the most finished form of
the pace, the horse is so closely united that the
secondly planted hind leg reaches the ground
before its diagonally disposed fore leg, and we
have again a gallop of four beats.</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that the galloping horse
should be in gallop right in turning to the right,
in gallop left in turning to the left, so that a hind
leg will be under the centre of gravity as a bearer
of the weight when the turn is made. If a horse,
in gallop left, be turned shortly to the right, it will
almost invariably fall, for as the horse leans over
at the turn there will be no support under the
mass. A horse at liberty instinctively changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the lead in the gallop as circumstances require;
but the mounted horse cannot be depended upon
to make the change voluntarily, and the rider
should demand the change at the proper time.</p>

<p>Before the appearance of "Modern Horsemanship,"
no one had described how the horse began
the change in the gallop, from right to left or
from left to right, or how it was performed. Dr.
Stillman, the only author who had touched upon
the subject, suggested that the horse changed the
lead when in air, but this was a manifestly incorrect
supposition; for the photographs show that
the hind legs are always committed to a certain
stride before the horse goes into air. By riding
trained horses in the gallop changes before the
camera, I discovered when those movements were
begun and how they were made, and I was able
to explain how the aids should be applied to produce
the changes; for previously, it had been a
matter of experiment and tentative practice with
each horse that had been taught to make the
gallop change. The loose explanations in the
riding regulations of every army, and even those
of such authorities as Baucher and others, prove
this assertion. I am somewhat familiar with the
writings of nearly all the authors of standard
works on horsemanship, from the days of Grisone
to the present day, and I cannot recall a passage
in any one of them that would indicate a knowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>edge
of how the gallop change was made, or one
that gave a rational explanation of how and why
the aids should be applied.</p>

<p>The gallop changes must have been successfully
demanded from time immemorial, but, as
has been said, it was always considered a difficult
performance to procure with certainty and precision,
and in many cases was made as a turn
was begun, the forehand beginning the change
which would leave the hind legs false for that
stride.</p>

<p>When the photographs proved that the hind
legs were committed to a certain order before the
horse left the ground in each leap, it was apparent
that the change must take place in the hind
quarters as soon as the legs of that part were
free to change their order; and that the legs of
the forehand must make a corresponding change
when they were free, when the gallop change
would be finished in one stride, without a false
step.</p>

<p>To make the horse change, say from gallop
right to gallop left, in any stride, the forces must
first be fairly united; the right heel should be
applied when the forehand is down, and as the
hind legs are leaving the ground; immediately
thereafter, as the forehand is rising, the left rein
should make a slight play which will insure the
change in the fore legs, and the change will be
completed without a false step and without any
disturbance of the pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The change from gallop left to gallop right
may be demanded in a similar manner, the left
leg of the rider and the right rein giving the
indications.</p>

<p>The gallops previously described are those in
which the pace is true, the only forms in which
lie ease and safety.</p>

<p>If the horse be in gallop right (or left) and turns
to the left (or right), it is false in the gallop, and
may fall.</p>

<p>If the horse has gallop right (or left) in the
forehand and gallop left (or right) in the hind
quarter, it is in the cross-gallop, which is wrong,
and the error should be immediately rectified.</p>

<p>To make the horse take gallop right from the
halt, the walk, or the slow trot, the rider should
first collect the forces of the animal, apply the
left heel, and make a slight upward play with
the right rein; when given sufficient freedom, the
horse will start off with the legs of the right side
leading.</p>

<p>Gallop left will be procured in a similar manner
by the use of the right heel and the left rein.</p>

<p>In a slow, measured, regularly cadenced pace,
the horse should be ridden in the gallop on
straight lines and on circles, the rider being careful
that the horse is in the true gallop on the turns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Habitually the horse should be kept in hand,
but from time to time closer forms of union should
be demanded, until the rider can bring the horse
to the half-halt and resume the gallop without
struggle or disturbance in the pace.</p>

<p>In teaching the horse to change from gallop
right (or left) to gallop left (or right) in the beat
of the pace, the rider should put the horse in a
slow gallop and after a while bring the animal to
a slow trot for a few strides, and from that pace
demand the gallop with the other side leading.
These trotting steps will be gradually reduced
and be replaced by the half-halt, in which the
change should be made; and, finally, disregarding
the half-halt, the rider will be able to demand
the change in any stride without breaking the
cadence.</p>

<p>In a slow, united gallop the horse should be
ridden on two paths, on straight lines and on
circles, in exactly the same manner as in the trot,
the horse being in gallop right in passing to the
right, in gallop left in passing to the left, the forehand
slightly in advance of the croup.</p>

<p>The wheel in the gallop is produced by following
a small circle on two paths, the croup toward
the centre. When the turn is so short and the
union so close that the inner hind leg of the horse
remains on one spot, we have the pirouette wheel,&mdash;a
very important movement for the mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
soldier and a valuable one for many reasons to
every horseman.</p>

<p>Many forms of exercise adapted to disciplining
the horse in various ways will suggest themselves
to the rider. As, for example, taking gallop right
on a straight line, bringing the horse to a half-halt,
making a gallop wheel, then a change of lead,
and returning over the same path in gallop left.
Or, passing on two paths in gallop left, coming to
a half-halt, changing lead, and going off at a right
angle in gallop right. Or, riding in gallop to
right (or left) on a single path on the circumference
of a small circle and changing lead in the beat of
the pace to go on a similar circle to the other
hand, making a figure 8 without disturbing the
pace.</p>

<p>With a little practice the trained horse may be
brought to make a finished halt in any stride of
the gallop without shock or danger of injury to
the animal. The rider, to obtain this, should
accustom the horse to come to a halt from the
walk, in answer to the pressure of his legs and an
increased tension upon the reins. Then the halt
should be demanded in the same manner from
the trot. When the horse has been taught the
various forms of collection in the gallop, the rider
may bring it to a halt in that pace by leaning
back, closing his legs against the sides of the animal
and raising the bridle-hand, at the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the hind legs are leaving the ground. The result
of this employment of the aids will be to induce
the horse to carry the hind legs simultaneously
under the mass and so stop the advance; and
upon the release of the tension upon the reins the
forehand will take a normal position and the halt
will have been effected in one stride. This position
of the hind legs under the body of the horse
gives an elastic bearing that will prevent any
shock that might injuriously affect the houghs
of the animal. All carefully conducted training
is assurance against strains or hurts to the horse,
and an animal that has not been schooled is far
more apt to slip or in some way injure itself than
one that has been taught to perform the most
violent movements of the manège. Of the scores
of horses I have trained, not one ever threw a
curb or a spavin while in my hands, and all of
them were the better in every way for the work
they were called upon to do.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pn center">BACKING</p>

<p class="pn p2">The saddle-horse should go backward in the
walk with the same freedom and lightness as that
with which it advances in that pace; and it
should pass to either hand with precision, the
spur demanding the changes of direction, the
bits, acting like a rudder, guiding the forehand
upon the path along which the croup moves.</p>

<p>A few lessons on foot greatly facilitate the
teaching of this movement.</p>

<p>The trainer, standing at the left shoulder of the
animal and grasping the snaffle-reins under the
chin of the horse, should, by means of a few whip
taps upon the rump, and the restraint of the bit,
make a fair collection of its forces. Then, after
the animal is standing quietly, he should renew
the whip taps upon the rump until a hind leg is
flexed as if for a forward movement; at this moment
the hand should draw the reins toward the
chest of the horse so that the raised hind leg will
take one step to the rear. The horse should be
led forward for a few steps, and be again collected.
In the same manner two or more steps to the rear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
should be demanded and the horse be made to
advance while the centre of gravity is balanced
and easily brought forward, the horse being kept
light and the impulses alert. The steps to the
rear will be gradually increased in number, until
the horse will back any distance evenly and freely,
the whip being ready to prevent too rapid a retreat,
and hand and whip maintaining the collection;
but the forward movement must always be
demanded before a complete halt is effected, and
an impulse obtained before the horse is called
upon to back.</p>

<p>The rider should then mount and bring the
horse in hand. By the pressure of the heels he
should demand an impulse, and when a hind leg
is flexed it should be carried to the rear; the
rider's legs should then close against the sides of
the horse, the hand give freedom, and the animal
should be sent forward a few steps. Gradually
the horse should be made to go to the rear for
any distance, every step being demanded by hand
and heels, the latter preventing too rapid or too
irregular a movement, the hand requiring the
raised legs to be carried back.</p>

<p>To turn to the right, the left leg of the rider
should give an increased pressure, and the right
rein, its effects measured by the left rein, should
give an increased tension upon the horse's jaw, so
that the forehand will follow the croup. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
turns to the left will be made in the same manner,
the right heel of the rider and the left rein
exerting the greater influence. In going backward
in the walk, the legs of the horse should
follow in regular order, but the first step to the
rear should be made by a hind leg, because the
movement begins with an impulse from the croup;
and to insure this the animal should be collected
before the movement is begun. The horse should
not be permitted to become heavy, but, by demanding
a close collection, every step should be
light and easy, and the balance should be such
that the animal will be capable of going forward
at any moment.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pn center">JUMPING</p>

<p class="pn p2">A very useful apparatus for teaching the horse
to jump cleanly and willingly is a little gate or
hurdle, about three feet wide, made with three
bars; the lower one fixed at eighteen inches from
the ground to bind the uprights, which should be
about three feet in height; the other two bars being
removable, one to fit in slots two and a half
feet from the ground, the other to fit on the top
of the uprights. But of course any bar will
answer the purpose.</p>

<p>With the upper two bars removed, the hurdle
should be placed on a bit of level ground and the
horse led over the lower bar two or three times,
the trainer holding the snaffle-reins near the bit.
When the horse has been accustomed to walk
over the bar, the man should take the ends of the
reins and let the horse cross in a slow trot; this
the animal will probably do in a leap, when the
man should bring it to a halt and reward it with
caresses. Then the next bar should be placed
between the uprights, and the horse, held by the
length of the reins, be brought up at a trot to
jump the hurdle and rewarded for its obedience.
After a few lessons given with the two bars, the
third bar should be placed on the uprights and the
horse be made to take the jump of three feet in
the same manner, being rewarded after each leap.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">If the horse attempts to avoid the hurdle by
running out at either side, it should be corrected
by a harsh word and brought back to make another
trial; and if it becomes stubborn and persists
in its disobedience, it should be given the
first lesson of walking over the lowest bar.
Whenever a horse shows a settled indisposition
to do what is demanded, the trainer should endeavor
to get some little pretence of compliance
and give up the work for the day. For if the
horse is not in humor for the work, it is idle to
persist.</p>

<p>When the horse is jumping in hand, the trainer
must look to it that the leaps are perfectly made;
that is, that the horse rises high enough in the
forehand, and no higher than is requisite to
enable it to clear the obstacle with the fore legs,
and that the hind legs are gathered sufficiently
under the body to bring them clear.</p>

<p>Should the horse not bend the fore legs to his
satisfaction, the trainer should touch the fore legs
with the whip just below the knee as the horse
rises; and should the horse be careless in the
action of the hind legs, a whip stroke under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
belly will make the animal gather the hind legs
under its body.</p>

<p>After the horse takes the hurdle with perfect
calmness when held by the snaffle-reins, the trainer
should accustom the animal to jump over the obstacle
while on the longe-rein, the trainer being
then twelve or fifteen feet away from the hurdle.
Then, the horse being habituated to jump the
narrow obstacle without reluctance, rugs, colored
cloths, or anything of the kind that might ordinarily
alarm a horse should be placed, first near the
hurdle and then upon it, as the horse jumps it at
the length of the longe-line.</p>

<p>The trainer should then mount and ride the
horse over the bar fixed at two and a half feet.
He should first take the horse up to the obstacle
in a slow, collected trot, using the snaffle-reins, and
when the horse is by its momentum committed to
the jump, he should give it liberty to take off as it
pleases and offer a light support as the forehand
again comes to the ground. If the horse does
not flex the hind legs sufficiently, a whip stroke
behind the girths will induce it to bring the hind
legs well under the body. But as far as is possible
the use of whip or spur as the horse jumps should
be avoided, and the animal should be mettlesome
and lively when it approaches the obstacle, and
be ready to exert itself with a will. The top bar
should then be placed on the uprights, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
horse be ridden over the hurdle now three feet
high, first in the slow trot, then from the halt, and
finally from the slow gallop.</p>

<p>In the jump from the walk, the trot, and the
slow gallop, the rider should incline his body
slightly forward as the horse rises and bend his
body back, more or less depending upon the
height of the drop, as the forehand comes down,&mdash;his
feet carried to the rear, so that there shall be
no pressure against the stirrup to disturb the seat.
Horses jump in all sorts of forms. Some horses
do not rise until quite under the obstacle, when
they squat down, go up almost perpendicularly,
and drop on the other side quite as suddenly.
Others take off at a fair distance, jump easily, and
land steadily. The rider must be prepared, however,
to bend his body in accordance with the
movements of the horse.</p>

<p>In riding at a very high obstacle, the horse
should be slowly collected at a moderate gallop;
and when the horse has faced the leap, the rider's
hand should give the animal liberty to act freely,
and as it alights he should offer some support.</p>

<p>I think that nearly every work on riding warns
the reader that one cannot raise the horse. It is
true that in the state of collection in which most
horses are ridden it would take a block and tackle
to bring up the forehand; but what shall we call
the pirouette, the curvet, the pesade, or even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
support the rider gives the stumbling horse so
that a leg may be put under the falling animal,
but a raising of the forehand?</p>

<p>In jumping, however, the rider must not attempt
to lift the horse; he must trust to the
instincts of the animal necessary to clear the
obstacle and for the disposition of its bearers to
secure safety in landing.</p>

<p>After facing the horse to the jump, the rider
should give the animal freedom of action, not by
making such a change on the tension of the reins
as might bring the animal down, but by giving
his arms such play that the horse may extend
itself. When the animal alights, it must find
some support from the bit, so that in case of
a peck or of a stumble the forehand can rise
until a bearer comes under the centre of gravity
and saves a fall. The bending back of the rider's
body as the forehand reaches the ground is, of
course, of great assistance in recovering from a
misstep.</p>

<p>In taking low jumps at a racing pace, the rider
need not lean back as the horse alights, for the
momentum is so great that no change in the body
of the rider is required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Sometimes, even under such circumstances, the
expected consequences do not follow a mistake,
and it is astonishing to see how a flying horse,
encumbered by a man upon its shoulders, may
recover from a stumble. But hurdle-racing is
poor sport, neither jumping nor racing.</p>

<p>When the horse will leap the hurdle willingly
and perfectly, it should be taken into the fields
and put over fences, ditches, and streams. Most
horses are at first timid in facing water, but with
a little care a horse may be made to attempt any
obstacle that is offered. In riding at broad water
or at any wide jump, the rider should sit down in
his saddle and send the horse forward in a good
pace so that the momentum will carry the mass
over.</p>

<p>In Great Britain and in Ireland, in those countries
where banks are sometimes the boundaries
of fields, the horses are taught, usually by easy
lessons in the cavesson or by being driven before
the trainer in long reins, to leap upon the top of
the bank and from thence across the ditch. The
dexterity and cleverness with which these animals
will poise themselves on the top of a slippery
bank, and the security with which they
will leap from such insecure footing, are things
to be wondered at.</p>

<p>We are told that some hunters are taught to
drive themselves forward by kicking back at a
stone wall. I do not dispute this, but I can say
that I have seen scores of hunters going over
such obstacles, and any displacement of stones
or striking of the walls was manifestly accidental;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and that from a study of the actions of the horse,
the kick, while in air, would in most instances
result in disaster, for both fore legs and hind legs
would be extended at the same time. I have had
horses kick out when jumping on the longe, but
the forehand would then be on the ground, and
a kick given at such a time would not benefit the
jump. The books say that in the capriole the
kick to the rear is given when the horse is in air,
but the photographs prove that it is given after
the horse alights.</p>

<p>In jumping for practice, 4 feet or 4 feet 6 inches
should be high enough. Most horses enjoy jumping,
but they should not be asked to do too much,
for they readily take a dislike to the sport. A
horse should never be punished as it is about to
make a jump; the rider should sit quite still, and
he should avoid raising an arm as the horse goes
into air, as so many men do, for the motion will
distract the attention of the horse at a critical
moment.</p>

<p>The standard of jumping has gone up so much
in recent years that one hesitates to say where the
limit will be found. A friend of mine has kindly
offered me a moment photograph of a horse of
four years of age passing over the extraordinary
height of seven feet one and three-quarters inches
(7' 1¾").</p>

<p>I once asked a professional rider of long experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the son of a professional rider, what advice
he would give regarding a fall from or with the
horse. He said that in falling he always bent his
chin toward his chest to save the neck, and made
himself as like a ball as possible. To this I will
add that the man should retain the reins in case
of a fall until he knows that he is free from the
stirrups.</p>

<p>Horses used for jumping should have strong
hind quarters, sloping shoulders, and good fore
legs.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that some of the finest
performers over high jumps have upright shoulders,
but the horses are good in spite of the
defect; and on the steeplechase course we often
see broken-down blood-horses come on as winners,
but these animals are none the better for
their injuries, and are certainly dangerous to
ride.</p>

<p>When a woman rides at obstacles, her line
should be on an arc to the right rather than
to the left, so that if the horse falls she will be
on top of the animal and not pinned beneath it.</p>

<p>The design in giving the early lessons in
jumping over the narrow hurdle is to habituate
the horse to take what is offered it without running
out, for when it has been disciplined to leap
an obstacle that could readily be avoided, it will
not look for means of escape when brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
face other objects. My horses will cross over
doubles, in and out, the reins hanging upon
their necks, and the obstacles no more than
two feet in width. In fine, a well-trained horse
will jump anything within its powers without
urging and in the safest manner.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pn center">GENERAL REMARKS</p>

<p class="pn p2">I am convinced that nothing has been recommended
in this work that is not absolutely
requisite in the proper training of the saddle-horse;
for the same general principles are observed
in what are considered the simplest
permissible military methods, although they are
not always attempted in the manner I have
followed. But even admitting that some of the
work is useful only for its discipline, to which I
do not consent, that would in itself be a sufficient
reason for retaining it.</p>

<p>I have been told very frequently, by readers,
that they have had no difficulty in understanding
the instructions I have offered, and I know that
they should be easily carried out, seeing that even
now I train my own horses without assistance.</p>

<p>It is advisable for the man who wishes to train
his own horse during rough weather, to have it
ready for the pleasant season, to keep the animal
in some public riding-school, where he will have
the use of "the ring," until his work is finished,
unless, what is better, he has some barn or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
other covered area where he may carry on its
education in spite of frosts and storms. It is
important that, once the work is begun, there
should be no interruption; and in our climate I
should say that April is the best month in which
to begin with a young horse in the open. During
the summer, the flies are so annoying that it
is difficult to keep the attention of the animal;
and neither man nor horse is fitted in the extremely
cold weather of winter for the work of
training.</p>

<p>Too much stress cannot be laid upon the
importance of sufficient and frequent exercise for
the avoidance of that nervous and excitable condition
in the horse known as "freshness." Of
course, a horse that has been thoroughly disciplined
is much more readily brought under control
than a young animal that has not yet been
taught to obey hand and heel instinctively, but
even the old, well-drilled horse may lose much of its
training if it be not very carefully handled after a
long rest with high feeding, and it is far better to
run no risk of insubordination. The fresh horse
may be considered as hysterical and sometimes
temporarily mad; even those which are most
docile when in proper work become flighty with
"stall-courage," and may bite, kick, or plunge
when first brought into the open air after some
days of idleness. These freaks do not indicate a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
vicious disposition, but vice may grow out of
them through injudicious treatment. Longeing
on the cavesson, a run in the paddock, or a brisk
trot under the saddle will soon relieve this condition,
but when the fresh horse is ridden, it should
not be called upon for anything beyond a good,
steady pace until it becomes composed.</p>

<p>Some jealous-minded horses are easily spoiled
by petting, and from too frequent indulgences at
improper times in sugar and in such dainties, and
show a nasty temper when disappointed in their
expectations. These animals should be treated
with uniform kindness, but should not be taught
to look for such favors every time the rider dismounts
or approaches. At regular feeding times
the one who is to ride the horse may give it an
occasional treat, never when the animal is bridled,
for the bit must always be clean and smooth.
A kind word or a caress is sufficient reward for
good behavior, and a harsh word is the most
effective correction that can be given. The whip
and the spur must be employed to enforce
demands, but these instruments should be used
promptly and for reasons, never for punishment.
For example, if a horse hangs back, or shows a
disinclination to pass an object, a smart rap of the
rod will usually send it along; but if there is a
positive refusal, repeated applications of the whip
or spur will work great harm, and the rider should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
obtain the desired obedience by some ruse which
will have a lasting good effect upon the animal.</p>

<p>A moment's reflection should show the reader
that a "combined horse" (that is, one suited for
harness and riding) is an anomaly, for the first
requisite in a saddle-horse is that it should have
a carriage that is inconsistent with that to which
it is accustomed in drawing loads. There would
be no great harm in putting a young horse in
light harness for a short time to steady it, but
after its training for the saddle has been undertaken
it should never bear a collar. A horse that
is habituated to harness cannot have light and
balanced action under the rider. The animal
that is taught to throw its weight against the
traces will travel upon its shoulders and be apt
to trip when the weight of a man augments the
defects of that mode of moving. The day before
this page was written a friend of the author
remarked that a "combined horse" which had
never made a mistake in harness had just given
him a fall; and a great number of such instances
might be cited. A poor rider may throw any
horse, and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred a
fall is the fault of the rider, but it requires a good
and careful horseman to keep old Dobbin on his
feet when the animal is taken out of the shafts
and put under the saddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The only certain method of correcting the
faults of a spoiled horse is to retrain the animal
from the very first lessons in the cavesson. In
this manner discipline may be reëstablished, but
the animal will nearly always be disposed to
revert to old tricks, particularly so if it remains in
the hands of him who has permitted the liberties
which grew into vice. Some horses are ever on
the lookout for opportunities of taking advantage
of a timid or irresolute rider, and such are out of
place with him who lacks nerve, and should be
turned over to better horsemen. When faults are
due to incurable physical or mental defects, it is
useless to attempt to remedy them. That much
may be done by skilful work to render such
animals less dangerous is true, but the game is
not worth the candle. A horse that is ground-shy,
that is, one which sees objects at its feet in a
distorted form, or that is subject to fits of terror
or excitement, is not suited to the saddle. On
the other hand, it will not be difficult to find
horses that will prove perfectly tractable and
steady as long as they have regular work. For
years I made a study of the vices of the horse by
taking such as had proved troublesome to see
what could be done in the way of correcting
various faults. From my experience I think it
may be said that all horses are amenable to
discipline except those that are foolish or of
such nervous conditions that they are in effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
unmanageable. The bolter was stopped by the
spurs; the rearing horse was cured by suppling;
the restive horse was confused and conquered;
the bully yielded to bullying; but the fool horse
took no degree.</p>

<p>The growing fancy for saddle-horses of large
size, because, perhaps, they are more effective to
the eye, is an evil, for breeders will undertake to
furnish such animals as are in demand at the
expense of far more valuable qualities, and the
rearing of medium-sized, active horses will be
largely discontinued, for the market rules the
stock farm. It is the experience of all horsemen
that 15½ hands is the limit of height for a perfect
saddle-horse, except under very exceptional circumstances.
When the would-be seller of a leggy
horse asserts that "it rides like a pony," he
recognizes the general superiority of the smaller
animal and probably is in error regarding his own.
As a rule, a horse under 15¾ is more active, hardier,
and with greater stamina than one above that
height. It is quality that gives value to the
horse, and this is usually found to deteriorate in
those of excessive bulk. Did not Dickens remark
that giants are weak in the knees?</p>

<p>In a previous chapter I have said that casting a
horse by the so-called Rarey system is not a sovereign
cure for all vices, and that I usually taught my
horses to lie down without using any apparatus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
When a horse is so vicious that a man may not
approach him without being attacked, some
artificial restraint must be resorted to and straps
used to confine and throw the horse. But with
steady horses there are several modes for casting
them without the employment of anything beyond
the snaffle-bridle. Of course, it is not necessary
for an ordinary saddle-horse to be taught to lie
down, but a good horseman should know how to
demand anything, and a little superfluous knowledge
may be handed over to some one who may
have use for it.</p>

<p>A very easy way of casting a horse is for the
man to stand on the off or right side of the animal
and pick up its right fore leg in his left hand; this
he will carry back and at the same time draw the
snaffle-reins, held in the right hand, to the rear,
until the horse comes down upon the knee of the
right fore leg; a pull upon the left snaffle-rein
will then bring the horse over on its right side.
After some lessons given in this manner, the horse
will carry back the right fore leg at the application
of the whip and be brought to the ground by the
same use of the snaffle-reins as above described.
After a few such lessons the rider should get into
the saddle, and between the taps of the whip on
the right shoulder and bending the head of the
horse sharply to the left he can bring the horse to
ground while he is mounted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>It is better for the trainer to avoid working the
young horse when exposed to high winds, as the
animal is then so disturbed and easily irritated that
it is difficult to engage its attention, and good
progress can hardly be obtained. If on any
occasion the young horse persists in refusing
obedience, the trainer will do well to obtain something
resembling discipline and return the horse
to the stable rather than enter into a contest which
may be the source of much future trouble. Of
course, if an old horse is mutinous, it should be at
once controlled and brought to reason; but except
an occasional lark due to excessive high spirits
from want of work, a trained horse will not often
be guilty of misconduct, and even then it may be
checked by hand and heel.</p>

<p>No one should ride a horse that has the habit
of stumbling, but sometimes the most agile of
animals will step on a rolling stone or make a
mistake through carelessness. When a good
horse trips and falls, the rider is almost always in
fault; in the first place, for letting the horse grow
careless, and secondly, for permitting the animal
to go down. An active horse should never stumble
badly when ridden in hand; and if the rider leans
back and supports the forehand until a bearer is
carried under the centre of gravity, it is seldom
that the horse will fall. Many falls are occasioned
by the horse being leg weary through overwork
or from being ridden too rapidly at turns; so that,
however the mark comes, a broken knee is taken
as a sign of poor or careless riding.</p>

<p>Doubtless, instruction was given in the art of
riding by amateurs or by professed teachers, from
the time the horse came into use. The earliest
existing work on horsemanship is that of Xenophon
(born 430 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>); then there is a hiatus until
the Italian Renaissance, since which epoch we
have had many works on the subject; but before
Xenophon's time, and between that and the appearance
of Grisone's printed work in 1550 (my
copy, apparently a first edition, was dated 1560),
we may be sure that there was no lack of writings
upon the subject, lost through the perishable
nature of the form in which an author's labors
were presented. Of the early works of this second
appearance the best known are those of Antoine
de Pluvinel, equerry to Louis XIII. of
France,&mdash;a splendid effort, published in Paris in
1619,&mdash;and that of the Duke of Newcastle, published
in Antwerp in 1651. But none of the
works on horsemanship which appeared previously
to that of Baucher are now of any real
value, and the method described by the French
master is the foundation of all that is good in any
modern system.</p>

<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="pn p2">All games, pastimes, and sports worthy of the
name are artificial work. What our ancestors
did because they must to live, we do because we
find that vigorous use of our powers, physical,
mental, and moral, makes living more agreeable.</p>

<p>They rode and shot and fished, walked, ran,
carried heavy weights, chopped down trees, paddled
canoes, sailed boats, fought wild beasts,
hunted game for food, and drove oxen, mules,
and horses because they had to do these things
to live.</p>

<p>We do many of these same things. We chop
down trees, paddle canoes, sail boats, run, jump,
struggle against one another with the gloves or
at football, swim, play golf and tennis, ride and
drive, but we call it sport! In reality it is artificial
work.</p>

<p>Because the environment has changed, and we
are no longer forced to do these things for a
living and to live at all, we now do them to
make our own living more wholesome and agreeable,
and call these pursuits sports.</p>

<p>Either because human life originally was safest
to those who were most formidable at work and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[IV]</a></span>
at war, or because we are so constituted that we
cannot live without exercise, we still continue the
physical exertions of our forebears under the name
of sport.</p>

<p>The quality and the value of all games and
sports may be tested and graded as to their
respective value according as they develop in
their patrons the qualities that hard work develops.
Health, courage, serenity of spirit, good
manners, good nerves, tenacity of purpose, physical
strength, were the reward of the hard worker.
Those same qualities ought to be the aim of the
good sportsman. The moment trickery, effeminacy,
babyism, and unfair play become a part of
sport, the whole object of sport, its <i>raison d'être</i>,
vanishes.</p>

<p>Sport, therefore, has ample excuse for being,
and deserves the support of all serious well-wishers
of their fellow-men to keep it clean.</p>

<p>The more seriously, then, sport is undertaken,&mdash;the
more nearly it resembles work, in short,&mdash;the
more completely it accomplishes its purpose.
It goes without saying that when sport absorbs
the whole man it defeats its own aim, since it is
intended merely to supplement by artifice what
has been lost by the changes in man's environment.
Now that shooting, fishing, sailing, sparring,
riding, driving, are not necessities, we wish
to retain still the good results of them for men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[V]</a></span>
doomed by the rearrangement of life to live more
or less sedentary lives.</p>

<p>Hence it is that books are written on these
subjects, that men may take them up seriously,
study them, use their heads at them, and thus
get the best there is out of them. The men who
are best worth preserving are just the men who
will give but a half-hearted allegiance to anything,
unless it asks much of them and makes
large drafts upon their mental, moral, and physical
energy.</p>

<p>To discover to man or boy, therefore, how
much there is of training for his mind and his
body in any form of sport is well worth while.
The more clear it is that a sport or game requires
knowledge, patience, courage, tact, and
endurance, all of which make for success in
everyday life, the more likely it is that it will
become popular among sturdy men.</p>

<p>The best of our sports and games are, as we
should expect, the most difficult, and require the
most complete development in their patrons.
Chess, whist, cricket, golf, fencing, sparring, riding
across country, hunting, fishing, have kept
their place, not because they are easy, but because
they are hard. All these games have been
played for centuries, while the more childish pastimes
and sports come and go, and ping-pong
their way to an early oblivion. The subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[VI]</a></span>
this book, the horse and how to handle him in
harness, has not only the advantage of a sport
requiring much knowledge, and good physical
ability, and great moral self-control, but it has
the further very great advantage of teaching all
who take part in it something of what is due to
the welfare of the most useful animal in the
world. This sport not only develops its patron,
but in so doing makes for the development
and better care of the most valuable helpmeet
man has.</p>

<p>It is absurd to suppose that a man can be
taught to drive without knowing something of
the elementary things about the horse. He may
be put upon the box, the reins placed in his
hands, and certain cut-and-dried instructions given
him about stopping, starting, and turning; but
before he has driven five miles fifty things will
occur to him that he will wish to know about.
A child with a box of colors and some sketches
in outline can be told to paint this part red, that
part blue, that white, the other green, and so on,
and there follows a picture of a kind. But the
painter knows how and why the colors are mixed,
and could never be more than an automaton if
he did not study these things for himself. A
man on a box-seat with four reins in his hand,
who does not know how the horses in front of
him are housed, fed, shod, harnessed, and bitted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[VII]</a></span>
and how by evolution they came to be what they
are physically and mentally, and the relative positions
of their vital organs and the bones of their
skeletons, is not and will not be a coachman of
any competency until he knows something of
these things. No man can bit a horse who
knows nothing of the inside of a horse's mouth;
nor can he fit him properly with his collar unless
he knows the relative positions of the shoulder-blade
and humerus; nor can he see that his
shoes are put on to fit him unless he knows
something of the formation of his foot; nor can
he spare him fatigue and help him through his
simpler troubles on the road, or in the stable,
unless he knows something of the horse's physical
make-up and the weak and strong points
of him.</p>

<p>It is a great sport, is driving, and superior to
all other sports in one respect at least, in that
it is the most useful of sports. Any improvement
in the art of driving actually adds to the
wealth of the world (<i>vide</i> chapter on the Economic
Value of the Horse).</p>

<p>In this book we have begun at the beginning,
and the proper title of the book would be, Hints
on the History, Housing, Harnessing, and Handling
of the Horse. Each one of these subjects
would require a volume, and volumes indeed
have been written. A complete bibliography of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[VIII]</a></span>
horse literature would number well on toward
three thousand volumes.</p>

<p>In this small volume it is intended to suggest
to horse owners the necessary lines of knowledge,
with something more than the elements
of each. The bibliography at the end of the
volume offers the opportunity to go more deeply
into any or all of these departments as taste,
fancy, or love of the sport may dictate. No one
volume can do more than this, and to each individual
is given the opportunity to discover what
he ought to know, and the opportunity to supplement
his knowledge according to his particular
requirements.</p>

<p>For suggestions, good counsel, and valuable
information I am indebted to many. Among
them I must mention here R. W. Rives, Esq.;
Frank K. Sturgis, Esq.; Professor Henry F. Osborn,
of the Natural History Museum; William
Pollock, Esq.; Theodore Frelinghuysen, Esq.,
Captain Pirie, and Fownes of London; Howlett
père of Paris, and his son Morris Howlett, now
of New York; T. Suffern Tailer, Esq., late president
of the New York Tandem Club; and others.
They will, I trust, forgive my errors, and take
to themselves, as they deserve to do, the credit
for such value as this small volume has, in adding
to the comfort of drivers and the welfare of
the horse.</p>

<p class="pn center elarge p4">DRIVING</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pn center">ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE HORSE</p>

<p class="pn p2">In dealing with the horse as a source of national
income, or as an opportunity for sport and pleasure,
there is little to be taught Americans along
the lines of harness-making, carriage-building, and
other mechanical appliances for the comfort and
best use of the animal. But both owners of horses
and their care-takers are often lamentably ignorant
of the general history of the horse.</p>

<p>If one is to get most value out of the horse on
the farm, as a draught animal in city streets, or
on the road, in harness or under saddle, some
knowledge of his past history and present value
cannot be out of place. The harness, the bit, the
vehicle, may be right, but the head, hands, heart,
and temper of the coachman may be wrong. To
know how the horse came to be what he is, and to
know something of the kind of a machine that
he now is, will do much to explain his vagaries,
and even more to make his owner and user more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
patient, more gentle, and more intelligent in
handling him.</p>

<p>You do not expect poetry from a blacksmith,
nor a fourteen-inch forearm on a poet.
You deal with men the more comfortably the
more you know of their antecedents and training.
The same is even more true of this subject of
horses. It is not necessary that a man should
be an experienced navigator or an off-shore sailor
to enjoy a yacht; but on the other hand there is
no question but that the man who knows most
of these matters gets the most enjoyment out of
his boat. It is not necessary to write books in
order to enjoy them; but the practice of writing
adds an hundred fold to the enjoyment of other
men's books.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that a man should be an
accomplished palæontologist, and an experienced
veterinary, in order that he may take pleasure in
his stable; but some knowledge of these matters
adds greatly to one's understanding of the proper
treatment of horses, and greatly, too, to one's stock
of patience in dealing with their eccentricities and
obstinacies. "Mad men and mad horses never
will agree together."</p>

<p>The horse is not an intelligent animal as a
rule. He is the only animal that loses its head
to the point of its own extermination when not
restrained and controlled. He has no affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
recognition of even his best friends. Your dog
twists himself into extravagant physical contortions
when you return after a month's absence;
your horse, on the other hand, is no more warm in
his welcome than your saddle. He is, now that
he has been so long guarded and cared for by
man, a pitiably helpless animal when left to himself.
The mere fact that the reins lie on the dash-board,
that he hears no voice behind him, that he
is free, sends him off at a gallop&mdash;possibly to his
own destruction.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>A certain politician from Tennessee, in describing
a particularly erratic party leader, said that he
reminded him of a horse sold to a friend of his.
Many questions were asked concerning the horse,
and finally the seller was asked about his gaits.
After some hesitation he finally drawled, "Well,
I guess his natural gait is running away!"</p>

<p>This is true of practically all horses, and it is
because he is so well known to man and so useful
to man, and because he is amongst the animals
the greatest pleasure giver to man, that some
knowledge of his ancient and modern antecedents
and training is desirable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>America is the home of the horse in more
senses than one. We have more money invested
in horse-flesh than any other country in the world.
A very conservative estimate of the value of
the horses in this country is something over
$1,050,969,093.</p>

<p>Scientific men tell us, too, that the first horses
were natives of this country. The prehistoric
horse of America probably wandered across Behring's
Strait to Europe, Africa, and Asia at a
time when that passage was dry land. Though
the earliest travellers to, and the first settlers in,
America found no horses here, there is no doubt
that the horse originated on this continent. Why
the horse disappeared entirely from this continent
for a long period of time, while flourishing particularly
in Africa and Asia as well as in Europe, is
one of the mysteries that science has not explained.
Whether the ice age destroyed them, or a plague
or flood swept them away no one knows. Two
facts are well known: the first is that the oldest
remains of the horse are found in this country;
the second is that when Columbus touched at
what is now San Domingo in 1493 he brought
with him horses, animals that for thousands of
years had not been seen here.</p>

<p>In four hundred years we have become the
largest owners and users of horses in the world.</p>

<p>Our agricultural supremacy is due in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
part to our use of horse-power in our fields and
farms. Our superiority in this respect may be
seen at a glance by a comparison of the number
of horses in the leading European countries and
our own. It is to be noted that in many cases
these figures comprise, not merely the number of
horses on farms, but the total number in the country.
For the United States the number given is
for horses on farms only.</p>

<p>Iowa, Illinois, and Texas have each almost as
many horses as Great Britain, and these three
states alone have more horses between them than
any foreign country except Russia.</p>

<p>These figures do not include the mules which
are more extensively used here than in any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
country. Including, with the horses, mules, and
asses on farms, those not on farms, it is probable
that the United States has more work animals
than even the Russian Empire, Siberia included,
with a population exceeding that of the United
States by many millions.</p>

<p>The horse-power, including mules, on American
farms is at least six times that of Germany; twelve
times that of Great Britain and Ireland; eight
times that of France; thirty times that of Italy;
and six times that of Austria and Hungary combined.
This difference in horse-power on American
farms gives us a great advantage over other
countries&mdash;so great an advantage indeed that our
competition affects land values in Europe, and is
gradually forcing a readjustment of the industries
of the world. It is estimated that we have invested
in horse-flesh in this country $1,050,969,093. In
1901 we exported 82,250 horses, while in 1891 we
exported only 3110, and the number of horses
increased from 4,337,000 in 1850 to 16,965,000 in
1900. Since 1850 the number of farms has increased
296.1 per cent; acres of improved land
267.0 per cent; and of horses 291.2 per cent,
which seems to show that despite the increased
use of machinery the horse is still a necessity in
agriculture.</p>

<p>What could be gained economically by the intelligent
breaking, breeding, shoeing, feeding, harnessing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
bitting, driving, and handling of horses in
this country is not easily calculable. The difference
in the amount of work one horse can do when
he is properly stabled, fed, harnessed, and driven,
multiplied by millions, gives one some idea of
the economic utility of such knowledge. It is
well known that good roads add enormously to
the availability of agricultural land and has a
notable effect upon the cheapening of farm products.
The first men to agitate for good roads, and
they who do most to see that good roads are provided,
are the users of horses. One might indeed
write a telling chapter of eulogy on the horse, if
one gave him the credit due him, for bringing
about the cheapening of products necessary to the
comfort and pleasure of mankind.</p>

<p>This whole subject of the care of the horse
takes on a new aspect when it is looked at with
these figures in mind. Books on driving, riding,
and the like should be classed, not merely with
books of sport and pleasure, but with scientific
and economic treatises.</p>

<p>We are a nation with over a billion dollars invested
in equine machinery. It is an absurd misunderstanding
of the subject to look upon the
time, money, and intelligence devoted to the driving,
bitting, and harnessing of horses as so much
time, money, and intelligence devoted to a sport
of the rich and fashionable. If we had a steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
plant, or a coal company with $100,000,000 invested
therein, no investigation would be too
minute, no saving of labor here, no improvement
there, and no supervision would seem out of place
in adding to the economy and efficiency of such
an aggregation of capital. The man who can bit,
harness, and drive four horses, or two horses, comfortably
to himself, and to his horses, is adding
just so much to the understanding of a subject
which is of practical bread-and-butter interest to
every man, woman, and child in the United States.
Every ounce more of work that a horse can be
harnessed to do, every practical hint that the
master of horses can be induced to apply, every
yard of road that can be improved, take something
off the cost of everything we eat, drink, or wear.
To put a coach on the road for a few weeks in the
spring, to turn out a well-mannered pair for a lady's
phaeton, to temper the disposition of two horses
so that they bowl along pleasantly in a tandem,
may at the first blush seem to be merely the idle
vagaries of the unemployed rich. As a matter of
fact, the knowledge and patience required in these
exercises percolates through all classes of horse
owners, and produces a marked effect from the
utilitarian standpoint. We of the large cities,
with steam and electricity as our daily servants of
locomotion, ignore the twenty odd million agricultural
machines in this country that are helping to
feed and clothe us, and get to look upon the
horse as merely the fashionable physician's prescription
for the liver, under saddle; or a fashionable
appendage of wealth, when in harness.</p>

<p class="p1">In forty years we have increased from
33,000,000 to 82,000,000 in population; from
$174,000,000 to $873,000,000 in agricultural

progress the horse has played a very large part,
and, contrary to the general and ignorant opinion,
the horse still maintains his place as the most
valuable piece of all-round useful machinery in
the world.</p>

<p>One has merely to note the way in which this
valuable partner of our national prosperity is
stabled, groomed, harnessed, and handled to excuse
the writing of any number of books, and the persistent
hammering away upon this subject. Sport
and athletics are serious subjects because they are
so vitally important to the physical comfort of man;
and this branch of sport which deals with the
horse, is of surprisingly vital interest to the nation
when one comes to investigate it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The cruelty, impatience, and ignorance displayed
by the great majority of horse-steerers&mdash;they
are nothing more nor less than that&mdash;are
apparent wherever we turn. Not only the shockheaded
MicMac who tools the grocery wagon
about our crowded streets; not only the Sunday
boy who indulges his Rowena in an hebdomadal
picnic on wheels; but the hundreds of so-called
coachmen who drive the high-priced horses of their
masters in reins, bits, head-stalls, and collars fitted
without discrimination upon any horse that comes
into the stable,&mdash;all alike are in dire need of learning
how to make the most of their opportunities.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that every man who
owns, or handles, a horse should be a veterinary,
but the elementary principles of harnessing
and bitting a horse so that he can do his work
comfortably ought to be required of every one
who, either for his own pleasure, or for hire, has
anything to do with horses. Such an one ought to
know how he came to have his present teeth and
legs, his present mouth and small stomach, which
reveals at once the secret of many of his weaknesses
and their proper care. Not to know, or
to care to know, any of these things is to lessen
the value of your horses as work-horses very
materially, and to deprive yourself of the best part
of the pleasure of dealing with your horses, if you
have them and handle them merely for sport.</p>

<p class="pn center">THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE HORSE</p>

<p class="pn p2">It is a curious phase of the history of the horse
in this country that the ancestors of the horse
once lived in this country in large numbers, and
then entirely disappeared. The ancestry of the
horse has been traced back some three millions of
years, and through that period practically every
step of change, from the little five-toed whippetlike
animal, to the Percheron or thoroughbred of
to-day, can be illustrated by actual fossil remains.</p>

<p>The most complete collection of fossil remains
of the horse, and the best illustrations of the different
phases of his development, anywhere in
the world, are in our Museum of Natural History
in New York.</p>

<p>When the remains of the prehistoric horse
were first discovered, so little was known on the
subject, that the great naturalist, Richard Owen,
called him the <i>Hyracotherium</i> or "Hyrax-like
Beast," referring to the coney of Scripture, little
suspecting that there had been discovered in this
<i>Hyracotherium</i> the fossil remains of the horse of
millions of years ago. In the <i>Jardin d'Acclimatation</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
in Paris there are two little horses at the
present time each measuring under 24 inches at
the withers.</p>

<p>This little animal was first provided with the
flat, spreading, five-toed foot suitable to the low-lying
and marshy land in which he lived. His
teeth and mouth, and shorter neck and jaw, were
adapted to the softer and more luxuriant herbage
of that time and place.</p>

<p>As the water left the earth, this little animal
gradually adapted himself to the harder ground,
the less luxuriant vegetable growth and the necessities
of the situation, which required that he
should travel farther for his nourishment, and that
he should travel faster, to escape his enemies.</p>

<p>Pounding along on the plateaux, which became
his natural habitat, he lost one toe after another,
first from his hind feet, because they do the most
work in propelling him, and then from his front
feet. His neck and jaw grew longer as he was
obliged to reach lower and lower down to bite off
the wiry grasses of the plain.</p>

<p>In short, the horse's foot and leg are developed
from the short, slender leg and cushioned foot of,
say, something resembling the foot and leg of a
delicate-limbed tapir to its present form.</p>

<p>Compared with a man's hand, for example, the
horse's knee is represented by the human wrist;
the hairless spot of skin with its cushion beneath&mdash;fatty
cushion of the fetlock&mdash;represents
the prominence behind the root of each finger
opposite the knuckles; and the hoof itself represents
the nail of the middle finger of man.</p>

<p class="pn center reduct">Showing long crowns of teeth</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">There are other patches of callous skin, sometimes
called "chestnuts" or "mallenders," which
appear; that on the fore leg is above the wrist
joint or "knee," that on the hind leg below the
ankle or "hock" joint. These, however, are still
puzzles to the scientists, although in an old book
on the horse, by Youatt, he speaks of them as
diseases and prescribes remedies for their cure.</p>

<p>Huxley maintained that the theory of evolution
pointed to the five-toed horse, and he stoutly
insisted that the fossil remains of such an animal
would some day be discovered, and sure enough
we now have in New York City the fossil remains
of these prehistoric horses, carrying out,
even in minute detail, the steps of development
he had outlined. There is the horse with four
toes (Plate I.), then the horse with these toes
grown shorter, until they hang above the ground,
and finally disappear altogether.</p>

<p>Where the horse is left in a state of nature, free
to choose the ground over which he will run, the
hoof grows just in proportion as it is worn away,
and maintains itself without artificial means, in
perfect condition. On the other hand, where the
horse is turned out on low-lying and moist land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
his feet grow to great length. This is the case, for
example, in the Falkland Islands, where the whole
surface is soft, mossy bog-land; and here the
horses' feet grow to be twelve and fourteen inches
in length and curl up in various ways, so that the
animals can hardly walk upon them. The nails on
the fingers and toes of man, if not shortened by
abrasion from rough, manual labor, or cut and filed
artificially, will grow to great length, and as they
grow, curl inward and around the tips of the fingers
and toes, attempting to form, what the toe-nail
of the horse has formed, a hoof.</p>

<p>Man himself, who has recently taken to walking
in a proud manner, only upon his hind legs,
reserving his fore legs for painting, writing, gesticulating,
and feeding himself, is also gradually
losing the toes off his hind feet,&mdash;in many persons
the little toe being already almost nothing
more than a short and useless stump.</p>

<p>When you run your fingers down the fore legs
of a horse you may feel distinctly two of his toes
tucked away under the skin, and now known as
the "splint bones." Where horses are used continuously
to work on hard roads, this toe-nail or
hoof wears itself away faster than it grows, hence
the necessity for shoes.</p>

<p>It is this evolution from a five, and then a four
toed animal, to an animal that walks on the nail
of the middle toe, which makes the legs and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
feet of the horse such a very delicate and difficult
problem to the horse owner (Plate II.).</p>

<p>It cannot fail to be of value and interest to every
one who deals with horses to trace their development
as they increase in stature, and in brain,
and with greater and greater complexity of teeth;
at the same time that the number of toes decreases,
according to the law which rules that the
fewer the toes, the greater the speed; the swiftest
bird being the ostrich and the fastest mammal
the horse (Plate III.).</p>

<p>The teeth of the earliest prehistoric horses were
short-crowned and covered with low, rounded knobs
of enamel, like the teeth of monkeys, or pigs, or
other omnivorous animals, and entirely different
from the grinders of the horse of to-day. Along
with the development of the legs and feet of the
horse, from an animal destined to live in marshy
and forest ground, to an animal obliged to take
care of itself in open, grassy plains, came a corresponding
change in the teeth, from short-crowned,
to long-crowned (Plate IV.), enabling the animal
to live on the hard, dry grasses which require
thorough mastication, before they are of use as
nutritious food.</p>

<p>The teeth of the modern horse are, perhaps,
the most perfect grinding battery that could be
devised. There is an external layer of enamel,
and a second inner ring of enamel around the pit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of the tooth, and these grinding one upon and
across the other, as the horse chews, make a
most effective crusher and masticator of his food.</p>

<p>The incisor teeth of the horse have all the great
peculiarity, not found in the teeth of any other
mammal, and only in the <i>Equidæ</i> of comparatively
recent geological periods, of an involution of the
external surface of the tooth, by which what should
properly be the apex, is carried deeply into the interior
of the crown, forming a pit, the bottom of
which becomes partially filled up with cement. As
the tooth wears, the surface, besides the external
enamel layer as in an ordinary, simple tooth,
shows in addition a second inner ring of the
same hard substance surrounding the pit, which,
of course, adds greatly to the efficiency of the
tooth as an organ for biting tough, fibrous substances.
This pit, generally filled with particles
of food, is conspicuous from its dark color, and
constitutes the "mark" by which the age of the
horse is judged, as, in consequence of its only
extending to a certain depth in the crown, it
becomes obliterated as the crown wears away,
and then the tooth assumes the character of that
of an ordinary incisor, consisting only of a core
of dentine, surrounded by the external enamel
layer. It is not quite so deep in the lower as in
the upper teeth.</p>

<p>Between the canines and premolars is a space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
called the "bars" of a horse's mouth. It is here
that the bit is placed, and not a few horsemen
believe that this space in the horse's mouth has
been gradually worn away by the use of bits
until now it has become a regular bit-socket
produced by the constant use of the horse by
man. This is only one of the many absurd
beliefs of the equinely wise in their generation.
This space is no doubt the result of the lengthening
of the jaw and head of the horse to reach
his food. As his legs grew longer, placing him
farther and farther above the ground, his neck grew
longer and his jaw lengthened, and lengthened at
a place where the grinding muscles would not
interfere. The incisor teeth, three below and
three above, developed more and more into effective
nippers, and the premolars and molars
into grinders of the most delicately complicated
and complete kind.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that this outline of
the evolution of the horse is part patchwork and
part surmise. On the contrary, the history of
the evolution of the horse is the best-known
illustration&mdash;and has been worked out with
greater detail and success than any other example&mdash;of
the doctrine of evolution by natural
selection and adaptation to environment. "The
skull of a man and the skull of a horse are composed
of exactly the same number of bones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
having the same general arrangement and relation
to each other. Not only the individual
bones, but every ridge and surface for the attachment
of muscles and every hole for the passage
of artery or nerve seen in one, can be traced in
the other." The difference is mainly in this:
in man the brain-case is very large and the face
relatively of very small proportions; while in the
horse the brain is very much reduced, and the
face, especially the mouth, of great size. One can
readily recall types of both animals where these
differences sink to insignificance.</p>

<p>Even the man who is least interested in the
ancestry of the horse cannot fail to see that the
horse of to-day is the result of thousands of
years of adaptation to his environment. His
legs grew longer that he might go faster; his
feet grew harder and encased themselves in a
hoof; his head and neck grew longer that he
might the more easily get his natural food; his
teeth adapted themselves to the nipping, grinding,
and mastication of that food; his bones,
muscles, intestines, lungs, stomach, and general
conformation inside and out, developed along
the lines that have brought him to the point
where he is far and away man's most useful sidepartner
amongst all animals.</p>

<p>These matters are worth keeping in mind
when you look over a horse with a view to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
purchase. So far as your purse permits, you
want the horse best adapted to your requirements.
As you look him over, you have at least
an intelligent notion of what you may expect
from his past history and the points of the animal
which indicate that he will bear out those
expectations.</p>

<p>Let us suppose you want a harness horse for
all-round work, one that will go single, double,
or in a makeshift four. It is not required that
he trot in 2.10, nor that he be able to be one
of four to pull a loaded coach ten miles an hour.</p>

<p>First of all, he must see. Next he must have
legs and feet to go on. Then he must have
room for a furnace inside of him, to furnish the
propelling force for those legs; and the more
intelligence he has, and the more good-natured
he appears, the better. Later, some of the more
prominent good points and bad points of the
horse will be noticed in detail, but it is as well
to say at the start that the horse-dealer, or your
most horsy friend, or the veterinary, avail little
to find you the perfect horse.</p>

<p>All that reading, study, and experience can do
is to avoid the worst faults, to keep in mind the
salient good points, and then to make the very
most of your purchase by care and training after
he is your property. You may learn the good
and bad points of a horse by heart and be as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
babe in the hands of a clever horse-seller, whether
he be professional or amateur. He knows the
weaknesses, and also the good points, of what he
has to sell, and you do not; and there are very
few Launcelots in the horse business. We have
all bought horses of a shrewd dealer and sold
them again for five times what we paid; we have
also bought horses and gladly disposed of them
for one-fifth of the purchase price.</p>

<p>The main trouble in the whole matter is that
buying and selling horses is looked upon by many
people as either necromancy or thievery. It is
neither. Study, intelligence, and experience are
as necessary and as valuable in choosing a horse
as in any other department of life, and in the
end are just as valuable. Art critics have been
fooled; book-worms have been deceived; lovers
have been disappointed; financiers have gone
into bankruptcy; educated men have been failures;
but study, intelligence, and experience still
rank high, none the less. It is possible that in
this matter of choosing a horse the aleatory instinct
in man comes to the fore and he is apt to
think luck plays too great a part, but, aside from
that, much the same qualities succeed here as
elsewhere.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pn center">THE EARLY DAYS OF THE HORSE IN AMERICA</p>

<p class=" pn p2">Why the horse, the fossil remains of which are
found so abundantly in the middle West of this
country that these places are known in the Scientific
world as "Equus Beds," became extinct,
there being no horses here at the time of the
Spanish Conquest, is a mystery.</p>

<p>It is the more remarkable, for when the horse was
introduced here and ran wild in South America
and Texas, he increased and multiplied rapidly,
showing that the climate, food, and general conditions
were exceptionally well adapted to him.</p>

<p>Various animals have been used as beasts of
burden, and even as cavalry, all over the world.
In the old days of Cape Town, the Hottentots
broke their oxen to the saddle and used them
even for cavalry purposes in time of war.</p>

<p>In a report of the Treasurer-general of Peru,
written in 1544, it is stated that the Spaniards
even in those days used the large sheep or llama
of that country both as beasts of burden and to
ride.</p>

<p>The first importation of horses into the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
world, credited by authentic history, was made by
Columbus in 1493, when he landed in what is now
known as San Domingo with seventeen vessels.</p>

<p>When Cortes landed at what is now known as
Vera Cruz, having sailed thither from Cuba, he
had with him the first horses that any man had
ever seen in the Western hemisphere, and this
was in 1519. The Indians thought these visitors
were from the sun, and that the horses were
fabulous creatures of incomparable prowess, and
brought offerings of bread and flesh to them.</p>

<p>Later, in the bloody wars of Mexico and Peru,
the war-horses, whose riders were slain, escaped
and reproduced themselves rapidly in the great
and luxurious plains, well provided with food and
water and in a climate especially suited to them.</p>

<p>De Soto had horsemen with him on his expedition
when he discovered the Mississippi River,
and doubtless many of the horses were left behind
to run wild when the survivors of that disastrous
expedition, without their leader, returned
in rough boats and rafts.</p>

<p>It is thought by some investigators that the
horses found by Cabot in La Plata in 1530 could
not have been imported, but this is highly improbable.
There is practically no doubt but that the
wild horse of America is a direct descendant of
the Spanish horse, and therefore of the selfsame
blood, which later made the thoroughbred in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
England, and the trotter in the United States,
the fleetest and most valuable of their race.</p>

<p>The first importation of horses into what is
now the United States was in 1527 by Cabeza de
Vaca; these, forty-two in number, were brought
to Florida, but through accident, disease, and ill-usage,
all of them died.</p>

<p>The next importation was by De Soto from
Spain, and these no doubt were the progenitors
of our wild horses of the West and Southwest.</p>

<p>In 1625, the Honorable Pieter Evertsen Hueft
agreed to ship, and did ship, to Manhattan Island,
one hundred head of cattle, including a certain
number of stallions and mares. These horses
were of the Flanders breed, from which descended
the Conestoga horse, afterwards justly prized in
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The first horses came to Massachusetts probably
in 1629. At any rate, we know that Governor
Winthrop, writing on board the <i>Arabella</i>,
at Cowes, March 28, 1630, says: "We are in all
our eleven ships about seven hundred persons
and 240 cows and about sixty horses."</p>

<p>English horses were landed at Jamestown, Virginia,
as early as 1609, and there is a tradition that
the first horse to land in Canada was brought to
Tadousac in 1647.</p>

<p>As early as 1641-2 we read of horses and carts
crossing Boston harbor on the ice, so severe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the winter of that year. In 1636, when the Reverend
Thomas Hooker and his followers left the
colony to found Hartford, Mrs. Hooker, so a letter
of that date reads, was carried in a horse-litter.
But the diligence and care of these first settlers
in New England is nowhere more clearly shown,
than by the fact that already, in 1640, Governor
Winthrop writes of shipping eighty horses from
Boston to the Barbadoes. Hardly had they imported
horses for themselves before they were
breeding them and shipping them to other parts
of the world.</p>

<p>These horses were not of very valuable stock.
As early as 1650 a young mare with her second
or third foal was valued at about $60; a five or six
year old stallion at about $55&mdash;this in Manhattan.
In New England, where cattle were especially
abundant, horses were worth about one-third less.</p>

<p>This is accounted for by the fact that horses in
England even as late as the beginning of the
eighteenth century were held in low esteem at
home, where they were valued at about fifty shillings
each. The better class of horses in England
at this time were brought from Barbary or
from Flanders. The well-known saying, "The
gray mare is the better horse," arose from the
recognized superiority of the gray mares from
Flanders over the English horses of that date.</p>

<p>Even as late as 1700, dogs harnessed to small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
trucks did most of the teaming in the narrow and
badly paved streets of the English towns, and
were by no means uncommon in London for
many years after that time.</p>

<p>One may judge of the condition of the roads,
and the difficulties of transportation, by the
charges. Seven pounds sterling a ton was
charged for transportation from London to
Birmingham; and twelve pounds sterling a ton
from London to Exeter. Coal in those days was
unknown except in the districts where it was
mined, owing to the fact that the transportation
of coal over the roads as they then were in England,
would have made the price prohibitive.</p>

<p>The demand for the better class of horses in
England at the time of the earlier importations
of these animals to America, was mainly for the
army, and for heavy horses to pull the carriages
and heavy travelling coaches of the nobility and
gentry. Such horses as were needed for these
purposes were pretty generally imported from
Barbary and Arabia, and from Flanders.</p>

<p>There seems to have been, however, a native
horse in Great Britain; for Cæsar notes the fact
that the Britons drove war-chariots.</p>

<p>William the Conqueror, who represents to
England genealogically what the <i>Mayflower</i>
represents to America, gave to a certain Simon
St. Liz, a Norman friend of his, the entire town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of Northampton and the whole hundred of
Falkley, then valued at £40 a year, "to provide
shoes for his horses."</p>

<p>From 1066 to the close of the twelfth century
there was renewal and improvement of the British
horse by importations from the continent, and
also by stray animals brought back by the Crusaders
under Richard and others; but such improvements
of the native breed as these importations
imply were of small importance, and without
system or aim of any kind.</p>

<p>During the reigns of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth,
important legislation looking to the care
and breeding of horses was passed, and when
James I., who was fond of racing, came to
the throne, he bought from a Mr. Markham
an Arabian stallion, afterwards always known
as the "Markham Arabian," paying for him
what was for those days the extravagant amount
of five hundred guineas.</p>

<p>This purchase by King James marks the
beginning of high-class breeding in England.
From then on, down through the reigns of
Charles I., Charles II., and William III., not
to mention Oliver Cromwell who raced horses
with the same enthusiasm that he sang psalms,
many horses were imported, much interest was
taken in racing and breeding, and for the last
three hundred years, from 1603, when James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
came to the throne, till now, England has
been the home of, probably, the best horses
in the world, and nothing pleases her people
as a whole more than to have the reigning
sovereign win the Derby.</p>

<p>The first volume of the English Stud Book,
then known as the "Match Book," was published
in 1808, and from then on we have had a more or
less orderly sequence of breeding history, and
the English thoroughbred race-horse, the progenitor
at one time or another of the best types
of horses in this country, became a recognized
standard of horse.</p>

<p>Our own horse history may be said to begin
at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The
Treaty of Peace with Great Britain was signed
in Paris, July 3, 1783, and the British troops left
November 25. The population of the United
States at that time was less than four millions,
about the number of people settled in and around
New York City to-day.</p>

<p>The carriage roads of Boston were unpaved;
and marked off by a line of posts and gutters,
and laid with ill-assorted pebbles. The horseman
who rode too fast over these pebbles, and
thus threatened their disarrangement, was fined
three shillings and fourpence.</p>

<p>The mail was carried between Boston and New
York thrice a week in summer, and twice a week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in winter, taking six days in summer and often
nine days in winter, and all carried in one pair of
saddle-bags. The post-riders knitted mittens and
stockings as their horses jogged along over the
well-known roads.</p>

<p>The very first coach and four in New England
began running in 1744, and the first coach and
four between New York and Philadelphia, the
two most populous cities in the colonies, was put
on in 1756 and accomplished the journey in three
days.</p>

<p>Two stages and twelve horses carried all the
goods and passengers between New York and
Boston, doing forty miles a day in summer, and
scarce twenty-five miles a day in winter. Josiah
Quincy, writing at this time, tells us that he once
spent thirty days in his own coach going from
Boston to Washington.</p>

<p>The streets of New York were so badly paved
that Benjamin Franklin was wont to say that you
could distinguish a New York man in Philadelphia
by the awkward way in which he shuffled
over the smoother pavements of the latter city.</p>

<p>There were but three roads out of New York
in those days: the Knightsbridge road, a continuation
of the Bowery Lane, which went to Knightsbridge
and thence along the river to Albany; the
old Boston post-road, which started from the
neighborhood of what is now Madison Square,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
thence to Harlem, and then east toward Boston;
and the so-called middle road, direct to Harlem.</p>

<p>In the southernmost states there were no
public conveyances of any kind except a stage-coach
between Charleston and Savannah.</p>

<p>It is only one hundred years ago, only the span
of two lives, and the population has grown from
four millions to eighty millions; the gross receipts
from postage from $320,000 (the gross
receipts for the year ending October 1, 1801) to
over $121,000,000 in 1902. The total estimate
for the expenses of the city of New York in 1800
was for $130,000.</p>

<p>These were the days when the fashionable
assemblies were advertised to "open with a Passe-Pie
and end with the Sarabund à l'Espagnole";
days when eight bags of cotton were seized by
the officers of the customs in England, because it
was claimed no such enormous amount of cotton
could have come from America; days when, so
writes Josiah Quincy at any rate, the minister
alone had white bread, "for brown bread gave
him heart-burn, and he could not preach upon
it;" and it was some fifty years later even than
this, before we had the wheel-plough of iron, the
reaper and binder, the drill, the hay-rake, and the
corn-cutter.</p>

<p>There was little leisure, and little money to be
devoted to sport of any kind, and the horse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the dog existed in New England, at least, in varieties
little suited to sport.</p>

<p>In the South it was somewhat different. A
jockey-club was organized in Charleston, South
Carolina, as early as 1735, and there was horse-racing
in Maryland, Virginia, and other Southern
states for years before the Revolution.</p>

<p>In New England, on the contrary, racing was
strictly forbidden on moral and religious grounds.
No such thing as a running-race could be tolerated
by the Puritans of that section. As a
consequence of this, we may trace the pedigree
of the American trotting-horse straight to Archbishop
Laud, who having infuriated the Puritans
to the point of desiring emigration for themselves
and their families to the new world, they founded
New England.</p>

<p class="b1">The scandalous levity and apparently papal
leanings of Charles and Laud were not to be
permitted for a moment in their new home, and
pretty much all amusements were frowned upon.
But the Cromwellian love of a fast horse survived
in some of his fellow-Puritans living in New England,
and men trained to the theological hair-splitting
of that day made a distinction between horses
<i>trotting</i> in friendly competition between church-members
and horses <i>running</i> for money prizes!</p>

<p class="ppq20">"Thou shalt not covet, but tradition<br />
Approves all forms of competition."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1 b1">Two horses trotting down the streets of Hingham,
Massachusetts, and one, perhaps, going a
little faster than the other, would hardly lead even
the godly Rev. Ebenezer Gay to suppose that he
was looking on at the beginnings of the sport
of trotting-races, and that a mare called Goldsmith
Maid would win for her owners over
$200,000 between 1866 and 1878 at this same
sport. Strangely as it may read, there is little
doubt but that Puritan principles or prejudices,
as you please, gave the impetus to the development
of the trotting-horse. Horses used for racing
had always run, but when it was discovered
that horses could also be raced at a trot, those
that showed speed at this gait were used to breed
from, and pains were taken to develop their speeding
qualities. Hence it is not flippant humor
that traces the trotting-horse back to Laud.</p>

<p class="pbq">"<i>Fast Trotting.</i>&mdash;Yesterday afternoon the Haerlem race-course
of <i>one mile distance</i>, was trotted around in <i>two minutes</i>
and <i>fifty-nine seconds</i> by a horse called Yankey, from New
Haven; a rate of speed, it is believed, never before excelled in
this country, and fully equal to anything recorded in the English
sporting calendars."&mdash;From the <i>Connecticut Journal</i>, June
19, 1806.</p>

<p class="p1">The first trotting-match of which there is any
authentic account was in 1818, when Boston Blue
was produced to win the wager, that no horse
could trot a mile in three minutes, and won it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
what the amount was is not stated. From that
time on, trotting horses against one another and
against time became a popular amusement. In
1834, Andrew Jackson trotted a mile in 2 minutes
42½ seconds; in 1858, Ethan Allen trotted a mile
in 2 minutes 28 seconds; in 1859, Flora Temple
trotted a mile in 2 minutes 19¾ seconds; in 1874,
Mambrino Gift lowered the record to 2 minutes
and 20 seconds; in 1874, the famous Goldsmith
Maid trotted a mile in 2 minutes and 14 seconds.</p>

<p>In 1843 there were only two horses that could
trot a mile under 2 minutes and 30 seconds;
while in 1881 there were over twelve hundred
horses with records of 2 minutes 30 seconds or
better.</p>

<p>Trotting in those early days was mostly under
saddle, and some of the races were even three
miles in length. Since about 1850 trotting-races
have been over a mile stretch, best three in five
heats.</p>

<p>It is noted as a curious fact in the history of
the trotting-horse that Messenger, who served a
number of thoroughbred mares, served a far
larger number of cold-blooded mares, and it was
in these latter that the trotting instinct was
almost invariably developed. This is repeated
through the trotting register&mdash;almost no thoroughbreds
have been trotting dams. Palo Alto is
about the only half-breed that was a successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
trotter, and one campaign finished him. Messenger
was imported in 1792 and was at stud in New
York and in Philadelphia for many years.</p>

<p>The first known importation of a thoroughbred
to America was that of a horse called Bully
Rock, by the Darley Arabian, out of a mare by
the Byerly Turk, brought over to Virginia in
1730. A number of Derby winners were imported
to America before 1800, including Diomed,
the winner of the first Derby in 1780, Saltram,
John Bull, Spread Eagle, Sir Harry, and others.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten in dealing with the
subject of driving that not only the history of
the harness-horse in America is all very modern
history, but that the condition of the roads and
the state of the carriage-building trade prevented
any great progress until lately.</p>

<p>Carriages, indeed, were hardly an ordinary article
of manufacture until late in the reign of
Charles II., or about 1675. It is maintained that
a rough coach or wagon ran as a public conveyance
between Edinburgh and Leith as early as
1610, but little is known on the subject. The in-little-things-omniscient
Pepys writes in his diary
under date of 1665 of springs on certain carriages.
But coach and carriage-building had not progressed
very far till later than this. The state
coach of George III., 1762, weighed four tons, was
24 feet long, 8 feet 3 inches wide, 12 feet high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and had a pole 12 feet long. "Hansom's Patent
Safety Cab" did not appear until 1834.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1669, a coach, described as
the "Flying Coach," went from Oxford to London
in one day, a distance now covered in an
hour and three-quarters by rail. This Flying
Coach departed on its first trip from Oxford surrounded
by the dignitaries of the town and the
university, and was welcomed in London by no
less imposing official personages.</p>

<p>With this coach and others to follow, began all
sorts of objections to conveyances going at this
rate of speed. It was contended that they would
spoil the roads, ruin the inns along the route by
not stopping at them, and do great harm to the
breed of horses by promoting speed at the expense
of bone and weight.</p>

<p>It is curious to think that even the first mail-coach
was criticised on much the same grounds
as the first railroad trains. There was little
danger either in England or in America of unduly
fast travel with horses and vehicles in their
then condition.</p>

<p>Even now in the United States the condition
of the roads, except in and around the wealthier
cities, is deplorable. In the last quarter of a century
in this country we have built 132,865 miles
of steam railway and we now have 203,133 miles
of railroad. During the past fifteen years we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
have built some 23,000 miles of trolley road; we
have spent in ten years $176,226,934 for the improvement
of rivers and harbors, but for the inland
farmer almost nothing has been done to give
him good wagon roads. There are 74,097 miles
of public highway in the state of New York alone.</p>

<p class="b1">It is calculated that $1.15 will haul a ton&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq10">Five miles on a common road,<br />
Twelve and one-half to fifteen miles on a well-made road,<br />
Twenty-five miles on a trolley road,<br />
Two hundred and fifty miles on a steam railway,<br />
One thousand miles on a steamship.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">France has 23,603 miles of wagon roads built
and maintained by the government. Italy has
some 5000 miles of road built and maintained
by the government. Here in the United States,
where more and more depends upon the ability
of the farmers, small and large, to get their produce
quickly and safely to market, nothing has
been done as yet by the Federal government. It is
worth knowing that a pair of horses drawing a
load of 4000 pounds on a level road with a certain
effort, can only draw with the same effort&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq10">3600 pounds on a road with a grade of 1 foot rise in 100 feet,<br />
3200 pounds on a road with a grade of 1 foot rise in  50 feet,<br />
2880 pounds on a road with a grade of 1 foot rise in  40 feet,<br />
2160 pounds on a road with a grade of 1 foot rise in  25 feet,<br />
1600 pounds on a road with a grade of 1 foot rise in  20 feet.</p>

<p class="p1">It is worth knowing, too, that careful experiments
prove that wide tires&mdash;3 to 4 inches&mdash;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
lighter in their draught than narrow tires.
That they are better for the road is very apparent.
The wider tires act almost as a stonecrusher,
and actually help to keep roads in repair.</p>

<p>In Austria, all wagons carrying a load of more
than 2¼ tons are obliged by law to have wheels
with rims 4⅓ inches wide.</p>

<p>In France, the tires of wheels on wagons used for
carrying heavy loads are from 4 to 6 inches wide
and some of them as much as 10 inches wide.
In France, too, the rear axles on such wagons
are made from 12 to 14 inches wider than the
front axles, so that the rear wheels run outside
the track of the front wheels, thus making a very
effective road improver of every heavy wagon.</p>

<p>In Germany, the law requires that all wagons
carrying heavy loads shall have tires to their
wheels at least 4 inches wide.</p>

<p>It is now within the jurisdiction of boards of
supervisors, in the state of New York at least, to
enact laws regulating the width of tires on heavy
wagons.</p>

<p>What good roads and wide tires and properly
cared for and properly harnessed and handled
horses would mean to us, in this, now the
greatest agricultural and manufacturing country
in the world, is almost beyond calculation.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pn center">POINTS OF THE HORSE</p>

<p class="pn p2">Though you will probably never find just the
horse you want for your particular purpose, that
is no reason for not knowing something about
the ideal horse.</p>

<p>There must be some intelligent and rational
notions in regard to a horse if you are to choose
one. It is better to know what one wants, and to
keep it clear in mind, in this world, even if one
never gets it. It is as sure as anything can be
that the man who does not know what he wants
will not get it.</p>

<p>Probably the best way to know a good horse
is to study attentively a fine specimen of harness-horse
(Plate IX.), polo pony (Plate VII.), saddle-horse
(Plate VIII.), coach-horse, light-harness horse
(Plate XIII.), children's pony (Plates XI., XII.),
and carry the type in your mind's eye for reference
(Plate XXX.).</p>

<p>A man learns to know a good book by years
of intelligent study of good books; he comes to
know a good picture by seeing the best pictures.
The man who has seen champion Lord Lismore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
knows forever after what an Irish setter ought
to look like; the man who has seen Pierre Lorillard's
Geneva knows what a light-weight Llewellyn
setter ought to look like.</p>

<p>No instrument has been invented which can
teach a man to know a good book, a good picture,
a good dog, a good horse, or a good woman. No
such instrument will ever be invented, and that
is what makes life so surprisingly unexpected,
interesting, and exciting. We may deplore our
ignorance, but it is precisely this which keeps us
all alive.</p>

<p>To begin with, then, the head of the ideal horse
should be lean, the skin fine, the bones prominent,
the muscles well developed, showing the masticating
apparatus in good working order. The
space between the jaws underneath should be
broad and well hollowed out There is a saying
that a man should be able to put his clinched
fist there, but such a test would require a very
unhorsemanlike hand. Remember that a horse
breathes through his nose, and that the air passages
from nostrils to windpipe always must have
space. The windpipe should be large and well
defined in its detachment from the neck. It is
preferable that his profile should be Grecian, or
straight, rather than either concave or convex.
He should be broad between the eyes for three
reasons: first, because that forehead is the roof
over the spaces through which he breathes; second,
because to it are attached the muscles by
which he opens and shuts his mouth; third, because
this space also contains the brain. The
eye should not be conspicuously small, denoting
trickiness, nor unduly prominent, known among
horsemen as the "buck eye," and often denoting
defective vision. It should be set well up in the
head, and when looked into should not show too
much white, and should be clear. The eyelids
should be thin and comparatively without
wrinkles. The lips should be thin and flexible,
and without undue length, either above or
below.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill330" id="ill330">330</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The ears should be lean, and the skin and hair
on them fine. A quick, decisive movement of
the ears gives an air of readiness and determination
and usually implies those qualities. A lop-eared,
hanging-lipped animal may turn out useful,
just as men with faces like Socrates and Savonarola
turned out to be saints; but in buying horses
and trusting men it is better to go by general laws
than by exceptions.</p>

<p>The head should be set on to the neck to give,
what is very hard to describe, but easy to recognize,
viz. an appearance as though the neck controlled
the head, and not as though head and
neck were all of one piece. At this juncture of
head and neck the distance between the throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and poll should, as compared with the size of the
neck elsewhere, be small.</p>

<p>The shoulders, not only for a saddle-horse, but
for the harness-horse as well, should be sloping
(Plate VIII.). Put a saddle on half a dozen different
horses one after the other and note where
the stirrup-leathers fall, <i>i.e.</i> how far behind the
fore legs. If you have no other way of knowing
whether the horse you are looking at has straight
or oblique shoulders, this will tell you infallibly.
Remember that about this question of shoulders,
as about most other points of the horse, much
nonsense is talked by the slovenly omniscient, of
whom there is a multitude in the horse world.
For though, as a rule, a horse can trot and gallop
and walk with straight shoulders, he can do none
of these exercises, except the last (that not fast)
comfortably to himself with straight shoulders.
Remember, in examining the shoulder of a horse,
that there is the shoulder-blade and also the short
bone (humerus) connecting the shoulder-blade
with the upper bone of the leg. This shorter
bone slopes backward and downward. The
shoulder-blade is the better the more it slants,
this shorter bone is the better the less it slants.
A good horse, whether saddler, road-horse, or
harness-horse, steps from the shoulder, not from
the knee. Do not be deceived by the up-and-down
action from the knee, which is often taken
to mean free and high action. The contrary is
true. Such a horse can travel all day on a tinplate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The ribs should be well rounded from above to
below, should be definitely separated, and of full
length. A horse with flat, short ribs near together
must, anatomically, be lacking in power. The
chest should be deep, but not excessively wide.
The depth of the chest measured around should
be large. When a horse is pointed out to you
as being "well ribbed up," this does not mean that
a line drawn from the bottom of his chest along
his belly should slope abruptly upward like a
greyhound; on the contrary, the loins and back,
at the point slightly behind where the cantle of
a saddle would come, should be broad, flat, and
powerful-looking, and there should be no appearance
of being tucked in, or tucked up, at the
hinder end of the back and loins. A line drawn
around the horse's body from the top of the withers
to the elbow-joint, and from the point of the hip
to the stifle-joint, would include between them
where the horse lives, and this valuable space
should be roomy and enclosed in muscular, but
elastic, walls. If you put a tape around a well-developed
and well-bred polo pony 14.2 in height,
around his barrel just behind his fore legs, he will
measure 66 to 68 inches; around his barrel just
in front of his hind legs 61 to 63 inches. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
same measurements for a well-bred horse 15.2
will be from 70 to 73 inches, and from 65 to 67
inches respectively. These are the proportions
of an animal "well ribbed up" in the best sense.
"Tucked up" or "tucked in" would mean that
the measurements are smaller in proportion, behind.
In looking over your prospective horse,
therefore, see that his body be well rounded out
not only in front but also behind, so that the last
ribs look to be long, well rounded, and having but
a small space&mdash;two or three fingers&mdash;between
themselves and the point of the hip. Depth,
shortness, and roundness of body are the essentials
(Plate VII.).</p>

<p>As for the legs, the upper bone should be long
in proportion to the lower or cannon-bone, and
should be large and well supplied with muscle.
The elbows should stand out far enough from the
body to insure freedom of action. The knee
should be wide from side to side, flat in front,
and thick from before to behind. The leg just
below the knee should not look disproportionately
small, or "tied in" as it is called, but should be
as large as other parts of the lower limb. The
tendons that run down behind the cannon-bone
should not adhere closely just below the knee.
This bone (cannon-bone) between the knee and
the fetlock should be short, straight, and strong.
The fetlock&mdash;the upper and lower pastern bones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>&mdash;should
be of moderate length and neither too
sloping nor too straight. Out of a number of
horses those with the best pasterns were those
who stood the following simple test: Drop a line
with a weight on it from the shoulder opposite
the middle of the leg; in the case of the perfect
pastern the line should end immediately behind
the hoof. If the line drops in front of the heels
of the hoof, the pastern is too straight; if behind,
the pastern is too flexible.</p>

<p>The hoof of the horse corresponds to the claw
or nail in other animals, and is made so that it
forms a solid, tough, horny case around the expanded
end of the toe. This non-sensitive substance
renews itself from within as friction and
work wear it away.</p>

<p>The feet of the horse should be moderately
large, with the heels open and the frogs sound
and with no sign of contraction. Big, spreading,
awkward-looking feet mean weight to lift, coarse
breeding, and usually a dull, heavy disposition.
Smallish, round hoofs mean just the contrary.</p>

<p>Behind, the horse should have long and wide
hips, with no appearance of raggedness, the stifle
and thigh strong and long, and the hind quarters
well let down, and not turned in nor turned out.
The hind feet should be under the end of the
croup, and the hocks and fetlocks should be a
little back of a line dropped from the buttocks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
The hock should have plenty of bone, be neatly
outlined, wide, and thick. The bones below the
hock should be flat, the tendons well developed
and standing out from the bone, the feet and
pasterns as in front.</p>

<p>The dock of the tail should be large and strong.
Muscular development there, means proportionate
strength all along the spine. The tail should be
set on high, and be carried firmly and away from
the quarters. A fat, awkward tail is a mark of
poor breeding. The tail of the well-bred horse
usually tapers off toward the end.</p>

<p>As a well-known Continental breaker and trainer
of horses phrases it: "I like a handsome head,
long and light neck, prominent withers, short and
strong back and loins, long croup, long and
oblique shoulders, close coupling between the
point of the hip and the last rib, hocks well let
down, short cannon-bones, long forearms, and
the pasterns fairly long. A horse should be close
to the ground, which he will be when the distance
from the brisket to the ground will be equal to
that from the withers to the brisket. A horse
which is high off the ground is generally clumsy
in his movements and liable to stumble." An
old-time writer on the subject of the horse claims
that a good horse should have: three qualities of
a woman,&mdash;a broad breast, round hips, and a long

<p class="p1">Xenophon writes: "The neck should not be
thrown out from the chest like a boar's, but like
a cock's should rise straight up to the poll and
be slim at the bend, while the head, though bony,
should have but a small jaw. The neck would
then protect the rider, and the eye see what lies
before the feet."</p>

<p>One cannot go to buy a horse with a tape-measure,
but certain proportions are well enough
to keep in mind. The length of the head of a well-proportioned
horse is almost equal to the distance:
(1) from the top of the withers to the point of
the shoulder; (2) from the lowest point of the
back to the abdomen; (3) from the point of the
stifle to the point of the hock; (4) from the point
of the hock to the lower level of the hoof; (5) from
the shoulder-blade to the point of the haunch.
Two and a half times the length of the head
gives: (1) the height of the withers and the height
of the croup above the ground, and (2) very nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the length from the point of the shoulder to the
extreme of the buttock (Plate XVIII).</p>

<p>One should never judge a man or a horse by
his defects and weaknesses, but rather by his
strong points and his general proportions. Any
political campaign will teach the absolute impossibility,
not to say imbecility, of any or all the
candidates; and yet one or another of them is
fairly certain to give us a respectable government.
Tammany has been known to elect an upright
mayor; Reform has been known to elect a weak
one. There have been trotters and runners of
surprising records with numerous defects of build,
and we all have one or more equine paragons in
the stable that are for sale at a moderate price.</p>

<p>None the less, there are certain defects which
should be constantly kept in mind. They are,
beginning at the head: a coarse, heavy head, a
thick, short neck, a small, sunken eye, a long back,
a hollow back (though there have been good
racers with sway-backs), flat sides, too much
length between last rib and hind quarters (a
mare, as compared with a horse, has, as a rule, a
lighter neck, a broader pelvis, is higher behind and
slacker in the loins), prominent and bony hips,
low at the withers, a shallow chest, fore legs too
close together and not straight, very straight or
very bent pasterns and hocks, much split up
between the quarters, tail put on too low and
hanging close to the quarters, flat feet, over-big
feet, contracted feet.</p>

<p class="p1">Of the age of a horse, after eight years, only
those who have given much time and study to
the subject can determine anything very accurately.
The receding of the gums and wear and tear of
the teeth, of course, are indubitable signs of age.
The lower jaw, too, as a horse advances in years,
tends to bend outward, making an angle more and
more acute rather than an obtuse angle. The
cross-sections of the teeth, too, are smaller as the
teeth grow up from the gums to supply the parts
worn away. Up to the age of six years the age
of the horse can be determined fairly accurately,
but even then difference in food and care make
a marked difference in the wear on the teeth.</p>

<p>The young foal has two and sometimes three
temporary molars in each jaw (Plate V.).
When about twelve months old another molar
appears (Plate V.) which is permanent, and before
the completion of the second year a fifth
molar, also permanent, appears (Plate V.). Between
the age of three and four the mouth is
completed with twelve permanent molars in
each jaw, or twenty-four in all (Plate V.). The
incisors are six in number in each jaw when
the mouth is complete, at the age of four. Just
back of these, on each side, at the age of four
appears a pointed tooth called a tusk (Plate VI.).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
These tusks are rarely found in mares. The
lower jaw of a horse three years old is marked
by two permanent teeth in the centre and two
milk teeth on either side. Milk teeth are easily
distinguished from permanent incisors by their
smallness, whiteness, and their more distinct
necks. At the age of four the lower jaw has
four permanent and one milk tooth on either side.
At the age of five there are six permanent teeth
and no milk teeth. At the age of six there are
six permanent teeth and the corner teeth are
filled in the centre. At the age of seven the
dark filling in the pit of the two centre teeth
disappears (Plate VI.). At the age of eight
(Plate VI.) the dark filling disappears from the
four centre teeth, and at the age of nine these
marks have generally disappeared from all the
teeth (Plate VI.). For all practical purposes
this measure of the age of the horse is accurate
enough, though it is apparent that the nature
of the food on which the horse is fed, whether
it be hard or soft, makes a difference. Horses,
for example, fed upon the fresh food of a farm
will retain the marks in the teeth longer than
horses grazing upon tough grass. As a rule, in
examining a horse's mouth only the lower jaw is
looked at. It is well to lift the lips above the
upper incisors to see if they are unduly worn&mdash;a
sure sign of "cribbing."</p>

<p class="p1">What has been written thus far as to the points
of the horse may puzzle the amateur owner, for
the reason that these points seem to apply to all
horses of whatever description. In proper proportions
they do. It is only necessary to adapt
these measurements and proportions to the kind
of a horse we want, remembering always the
well-known law, that muscles and bones of speed
are long and slender, and those of strength are
short and thick. A pony 14 hands 2 inches,
capable of carrying 200 odd pounds, and a three-quarters
bred polo pony of the same size, but
wanted for speed and quickness, would naturally
enough not look alike, but the general relation of
the parts to one another would be the same; and
in looking at one for a weight-carrier and at the
other for speed, you should bear in your mind's
eye the same distinct principles of what constitutes
a good horse and what a bad one.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a horse for your runabout,
or for a horse for a heavy station-wagon, one
should be lighter, cleaner-built perhaps, quicker,
and livelier than the other; but it is a grave mistake
to suppose that the same remarks about
head, neck, back, legs, feet, and so on do not
apply with equal pertinency to the one as to the
other. Remembering always that weight is of
great help in pulling a load,&mdash;a horse with a
heavy man on his back can pull a big load up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
hill that without the weight on his back he could
scarcely move,&mdash;the other general definitions of
what constitute a good horse apply to all classes.
A straight-shouldered horse is less noticeable and
less uncomfortable in harness than under saddle;
a slab-sided, ragged-hipped, goose-rumped animal
well covered with heavy harness in a brougham
is less offensive than under saddle, but such an
one is a poor specimen wherever he is.</p>

<p>The ideal way, however, to cultivate an eye for
a horse is to study his make-up externally and
internally from the plates of the skeleton and the
internal parts (Plates XVI. and XVII.); to bear
in mind what his ancestry is; to note the relation
of the parts to one another, and the position of
his various organs; to study carefully the dispositions,
abilities, strength, and weaknesses of the
horses that you know well; and to come to your
conclusions with this knowledge and experience
in the back of your brain. To be able to gabble off
the points of a horse <i>memoriter</i> avails about as
much as to know the letters of the alphabet avails
to write one of Rossetti's sonnets. Even then
you will make mistakes; but to enjoy the sport
of owning and using horses, either in harness or
under saddle, one cannot know too much, either
theoretically or practically.</p>

<p>Although this volume is included in a library
on sport, it should never be forgotten that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
dealing with every branch of sport, particularly
where live animals are trained and used by the
sportsman, a very serious ethical element enters.
No man who knows nothing about horses, no
matter how charitable he may be, no matter how
ecclesiastically regular he may be, no matter how
conspicuously tender-hearted he may be to children,
insects, and the poor, has any business on a
horse or behind a horse. First, because he is
almost invariably cruel to the horse; and secondly,
because he is endangering the lives of
other people. How often I have seen Piety in
the saddle, sawing the tender bars of the horse's
mouth, and sliding back and forth from pommel to
cantle of the saddle, excoriating the tender skin
and flesh beneath. How often I have seen
Philanthropy and Worth driving horses with
cruel bearing-reins, traces too long, pole-straps
too tight, coupling-reins of the same length for
the long-necked and the short-necked horse,
belly-band tight and girth loose, bit too wide,
nose-band flapping up and down, and breeching
too tight or too loose. Little did Philanthropy
and Worth realize that these things were as uncomfortable
to the horse as tight shoes, trousers
too long, coats too small, collars too tight, and a
toothache and headache to them. It is because
sport has been handled in this country to such
a large extent by the professional and by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
uncultivated, that its prime value as a teacher of
practical and economic morality has been overlooked.</p>

<p>Above all things, do not imagine that, because
you own one or more horses and stroke their
necks occasionally, that you know a horse when
you see one. Such knowledge does not come
by cutaneous friction nor by money. A wise
man has three attributes always; he may have
more, but he must have these: (1) he is never
afraid to ask questions; (2) he is thankful for
the many things he does not want; (3) he knows
when he does not know things. Therefore, ask
questions and make no pretence. The most ill-informed
man I ever met is one who has never
failed to answer every question asked him, and
who never asks one himself. It is needless to
say that he is a failure in his profession, a bore
socially, and an encyclopædia of voluble misinformation.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pn center">THE STABLE</p>

<p class="pn p2">Once you have a horse, the next thing is to
provide a place for him to live in. It may be
better to keep a horse in a livery-stable rather
than to have no horse at all, but certainly nine-tenths,
and something more, of the pleasure of
owning horses is lost if you have no stable of your
own. There are three classes of stables,&mdash;good
stables, bad stables, and magnificent stables; just
as there are three kinds of lies,&mdash;lies, damned lies,
and statistics. Wise men have good stables and
sometimes tell lies; ignorant and bad men have
poor stables and often tell damned lies; gamblers
and shoddy millionnaires&mdash;!</p>

<p>Whatever else they may have, good stables
must infallibly have light, air, and good drainage.
To accomplish these things, the stable should be
above the level of the ground surrounding it, if
only a few inches, to facilitate proper drainage.
It should face preferably south or west, to get
the largest possible amount of sunlight. Pay no
attention to any talk about "a dark stable." It is
an exploded notion. It is of course necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
be able to darken the part of the stable where the
horses take their rest; and it is a great convenience
to have a box-stall or two, separated entirely from
the others, where a horse may be kept quiet, cool,
and out of the light. But if necessity demands a
choice between light and darkness, choose the
light every time. Sunlight is the best antiseptic
in the world for either men or horses.</p>

<p>The size of the stable depends upon the purse.
It is not a question of the number of horses,
because no horse owner was ever known to have
all the horses he wanted. Just as every yacht
owner wishes to add just ten feet to his yacht,
so every man with a stable of horses could use
just one or two more to advantage. It is a fair
statement to work upon, however, that every
horse in a stable is entitled, for his health and
comfort, to nine hundred cubic feet of space, at
least. Next to the proper allowance of food and
water, this matter of good air in the stable is the
most important of all. The gases given off
through the lungs and skin, and those generated
from urine, and fæces, are poisonous and irritating.
Coughs, colds, bad coats, swelled legs,
general debility, are all due to badly ventilated
stables, and if a contagious disease starts in such
a stable, it is well-nigh impossible to save any one
of the inmates.</p>

<p>Bad ventilation does not mean necessarily that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
a stable is hot, nor good ventilation that a stable
is cold. If properly managed, a stable may be
so ventilated as to avoid either extreme. What
is wanted is abundance of fresh air without
draughts. All systems of ventilation are based
upon the principle that heated air expands and
ascends, so that the inlets should be below, the
outlets above. The inlets should be so arranged
that the cool air does not come in where it may
blow upon the legs of the horses or make them
uncomfortable when lying down.</p>

<p>All windows and doors should be kept in easy
working order, so that it is no trouble to servants
to open and close them.</p>

<p>For after all has been said and done upon
these matters theoretically, the practice will depend
almost entirely upon the man or men in
charge. I would rather have a poor stable, with
a first-rate man in charge of it, than the best
stable ever built, with a careless, indifferent,
ignorant, and occasionally inebriate man in
charge. No mechanical arrangements, no matter
how minute and delicate in their serviceability, are
of the slightest value when in control of the incompetent.
Spend time, thought, money, and patience
in building yourself the best stable your purse
permits; but in proportion spend even more in
procuring the man who is to be at the head of it.</p>

<p>When you get him, don't pamper him, or bribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
him, or kotow to him,&mdash;no self-respecting man
is held by such bonds,&mdash;but make him your friend
and run your stable jointly with him, respecting
him in his capacity and retaining his respect for
you in yours.</p>

<p>Above all things, abjure the maudlin sentiment
of the day, that there should be no master and no
man. The universe, so far as telescope can see,
the earth, from centre to rim, recognize love, law,
and obedience. Every intelligent man is the
servant of somebody, and ought to be proud of it;
if he is not, something is radically wrong with
him or the master he has chosen to serve. Try
to make the man in the stable proud of being
your servant. If you succeed, everything will go
well; if you cannot accomplish this with love and
law, then you will have to fall back upon some
makeshift, like money, and get on the best you can.
But make no mistake, and save yourself untold
troubles by realizing at the start that money
alone does not make good servants in the stable
or anywhere else. The sailors who fought with
Paul Jones, and the cavalry-men who rode with
Phil Sheridan, were not thinking much of their
pay. The manikin moved by money will spoil
your stable, your temper, and your horses. Study
carefully the characters of those who are continually
complaining of their servants!</p>

<p>The simpler the construction of the stable, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
better. Have as few separate rooms and as few
passageways as possible; this means light, air,
cleanliness, and convenience. If you are about to
build a stable, go about among your friends, view
their stables, and hear what they have to say from
their experience. Money spent in practical inspection
before building will be saved many
times over, in getting what you want, and, best
of all, knowing why you want it.</p>

<p>A few inches above the ground is enough for
drainage; if the stable is higher than this, you
have a pent to go up and down at the stable door.
In winter this is dangerous, and at all times it
frets the horses to slide out of the stable at the
start-off.</p>

<p>Your entrance door should be at least 10 feet
6 inches wide and at least 10 feet 6 inches high.</p>

<p>The ceilings in coach house, and over the
stables, should be at least 12 feet high, and a foot
or two more gives that much more air space.</p>

<p>Windows in coach house, saddle room, harness
room and cleaning room should be at a height
convenient for opening and shutting and always
in easy working order. Windows in stalls and
boxes should have the lower sill at least 6 feet 3
inches above the ground, so that the light shall
not be in the horse's eyes and draughts shall not
blow upon them. These windows should all
have shutters on the outside, should hinge from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the bottom, let down from outside in, and be
enclosed on the inside in a box to prevent side
draughts.</p>

<p>The stalls should be at least 9 feet long, though
10 feet is not too long, and at least 5 feet 7 inches
wide, though a narrower stall may prevent a horse
getting cast. If there are stalls on both sides, or
stalls on one side, and boxes on the other, the aisle
between should be at least 10 feet wide, that the
horse may be brought out and turned comfortably.</p>

<p>If possible, have one or two box-stalls completely
detached from the other stalls and boxes,
for sick horses, for horses needing rest and quiet,
and for new horses that may come into the stable
with distemper.</p>

<p>If there are living rooms over the stable, do not
have them over the horses. Horses ought to be
allowed to sleep in peace.</p>

<p>The coach-house floor should be preferably of
wood on account of dampness, though cement is
cheaper, and in a well-aired and dry stable is good
enough.</p>

<p>The aisle between stalls should be of brick, or
of well-laid small flint brick, laid in mortar, and
with the lines running parallel to one another,
and not in herring-bone fashion, so that a hose
and a stable broom can thoroughly cleanse the
cracks. Any other arrangement requires a knife
to get all the dirt away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The stalls should have brick floors, or brick or
cement, with a slatted wooden floor over it. There
are advocates of wood alone and brick alone for
the stall floor; the slats are a fair compromise.
These slats should run down the centre of the stall,
beginning some 4 feet from front of stall. The
slats should be held together with iron rods, and
either pull out bodily or move on hinges, so that
the stall may be washed out thoroughly with the
hose. The partitions between stalls should be
7 or 8 feet high in front and 5 or 6 behind. It
is well to leave a few inches of space between
the partitions and the wall in front, and between
the bottom of the partitions and the floor, for
circulation of air.</p>

<p>The ideal stall would have both a box-drain in
the centre, and a drain running at the bottom
from one end of the line of stalls to the other
at a slight incline. The latter is sufficient, however.
Horses should stand as nearly as possible
on a level. A slope of one in eighty is enough
for drainage.</p>

<p>Box-stalls should have a centre drain with a
well-secured top to prevent accident. All drainage
in stables should be surface drainage. Permit
no underground pipes, traps, or drains in
your stable! Boxes should be at least 10 feet 6
by 12 feet.</p>

<p>It is claimed by practical horse owners of long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
standing that no more straw is used in stalls and
boxes with brick floors than in those with wooden
or wooden slat floors, and that the former are
cleaner. It goes without saying that the less
wood and iron you have in stalls and boxes, the
better. They rust, corrode, get soaked, and smell.
In a well-kept stable your nose should not be a
factor in the recognition of the fact that you are
in a stable.</p>

<p>The harness room should be of wood throughout,
ceiling as well, to avoid dampness. Unless
you have dozens of sets of harness, some of which
are seldom used, and therefore conveniently kept
in cases, cover your harness-room walls with baize
stuff, and have your harnesses in the full blaze of
all the light and publicity there is. They will be
kept better.</p>

<p>Have a box with a baize stuff back and a glass
door for bits, chains, etc., and have it too big
rather than too small.</p>

<p>Harness room, coach house, saddle room, and
cleaning room should each have a place for a stove.</p>

<p>There should be no artificial heat where the
horses are kept. Well-blanketed horses can be
kept without injury even in an occasional temperature
of 30°, as happened frequently in many
stables during the severe winter of 1903-4. Such
a temperature is not good for them, but even that
is much better than artificial heat incompetently
superintended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Six or seven horses in one stable are enough.
They have more air, more quiet, are kept cleaner,
and the coming and going makes less disturbance
and does not change the temperature of the stable
so violently.</p>

<p>In this climate a stable of wood is cheaper,
cooler in summer, warmer in winter, and, at all
times, drier.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">PLATE XV.&mdash;STABLE PLAN</p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">After studying a number of stables and experimenting
with my own, I should build a stable&mdash;say
to accommodate seven horses, or fourteen at a
pinch&mdash;as follows: coach house to stand fourteen
vehicles (Plate XV.). The building to face south
or west. Horses to face, the majority of them,
to the north. Ground floor 4 inches above the
outside ground. Entrance door to slide and to
be 10 feet 6 inches wide and the same in height.
The ideal thing, of course, is to be able to drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
through your stable by having another door opposite
your entrance door. It only diminishes the
wall space, and is convenient in many ways, especially
in a country stable, where you may wish to
stand a horse and trap indoors. Drive in the door
on to carriage wash, sloping toward drain in centre,
this to be of cement. Sliding door to the right admitting
to the stables, with six stalls facing north
and two box-stalls facing south. Space 10 feet by
10 feet for cleaning harness, between box-stall and
wall that separate carriage wash from stables, with
a door at the end, half door preferred, furnished with
hooks and two telescope harness-hangers, water-trough,
and shelves. Aisle, 10 feet wide between
stalls and box-stalls, laid in vitrified brick, all lines
between bricks running into one another both
lengthwise and sideways for greater convenience
in cleaning. Drain in centre of each box-stall,
and covered drain running at foot of stalls.
Covers of all drains removable, and drains to
be easily washable with hose. Stalls floored
with brick, box-stalls of the same. Half door at
end of aisle to face large door leading into carriage
wash. In this climate, screens on all doors
and windows for summer. Windows as described.
Feed and hay to come down shafts on one side of
space allotted to harness cleaning. Trough in
that space with cold water only. Hot water to
be furnished by boiler on stove in carriage house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
No separate harness cleaning room in a stable of
this kind. The rough work can be conveniently
done in the space described, and the polishing,
dusting, etc., in the harness room. This saves an
extra room, probably dark, and at any rate another
room to be kept clean. Carriage house to the
left of carriage wash, preferably floored and
ceiled with wood, with hospital, or rounded corners
and edges, so that it can be readily and
thoroughly cleaned, 25 by 35 feet, which will
easily contain twelve to fifteen vehicles.</p>

<p>Harness room to be entered from end of carriage
wash opposite entrance door, to be eleven
by twenty-four, walls lined with baize and furnished
with fixtures for harness, saddles, whips, etc.
Two extra box-stalls, tool room, water-closet, and
separate entrance, with stairs to living rooms above,
built out from southwest angle of carriage house.
These box-stalls to have half doors, if possible,
opening into a small paddock and floored with
dirt or peat moss. Forty dollars' worth of Miss
Hewitt's well-made hurdles will make you a very
useful paddock and save scores of dollars in veterinary
bills. By all means have cleats to form a
ladder on the wall of the hay-shaft, so that the man
can get directly and quickly to his horses in case
of accident or danger. Poles, fastened to the wall
with hinges, so that they are not in the way when
not used, along the walls of the carriage house, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
robes, and rests for poles themselves. Chests
lined with tin for travelling and for storing winter
or summer clothing, blankets, robes, etc.</p>

<p>Hay should be fed from the floor, not from
overhead mangers. Feed boxes and water-receptacles
movable, that they may be from time to
time taken out to be scoured and sunned. Horses
watered with water-buckets and not by having
water in stalls always at hand. As regards this
practice, the theory is indisputable, but in practice
you have dirty water, stale water, water when horses
are heated or just after meals, unless you have first-class
servants; and if you have these, the buckets
are safer and save that much plumbing&mdash;the less
of which you have in a stable, the better. In such
a stable you drive your carriage in on to the wash.
The horses are unhooked and taken into the
stables, where if it is a raw day the door may be
closed. The harness is taken off, hung on hooks,
and the horses are cared for. The harness is
then cleaned and taken to the harness room, where
it may be given finishing touches. The carriage
is washed down and run into its place, and all with
the very minimum of going and coming and so arranged
that no dirt need be carried across clean
spaces. Horses, carriages, and harness are all
landed where they are to be first cared for, and
are then close to where they belong when cleaned.
This of course is an economical plan, and is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
intended to describe the ideal stable. It is merely
an ideal stable for a man of moderate means.</p>

<p>Once a week, weather permitting, all carriages
should be aired and sunned outside. It may be
said, however, that a thoroughly dry carriage
house is better than even this much exposure to
the sun, with the effect of fading cushions, trimmings,
etc. Saddles should always be dried in
the sun when possible. Once a week, too, the
coach house should be cleaned and dusted. Once
a week horses should be moved from their stalls
to other stalls or box-stalls, bedding removed,
slats lifted or taken out, if there are slats, and the
stable flushed and broomed out thoroughly and
sprinkled with disinfectant and water. I have
known stables where there has not been a sick
horse for years, except in the case of new horses
with distemper. The temperature of a stable is
best between 50° to 70°. The nearer it is kept
at 65° the year round, the better.</p>

<p>Into the details of fixtures, implements, architectural
and plumbing minutiæ, it is not the purpose
of this small volume to go. There are books
which cover this ground completely, accurately,
and in great detail, the titles of which may be
found in the Bibliography.</p>

<p>Although only the ground plan of a stable is
outlined and described here, the rooms above the
stable are important. The coachman, with or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
without family, should live in the stable, and it is
convenient to have the undermen there too if
possible. Horses should never be left to take
care of themselves through the night. The living
rooms should be properly ventilated, heated,
and provided with bath rooms, and everything
within reason done to make those who care for
the horses at least as comfortable as the horses.</p>

<p>Racing stables, breeding stables, stables for
twenty and thirty horses, are subjects in themselves,
although the principles outlined here
must of necessity obtain in a good stable of whatever
size and for whatever purpose. There are two
stables, that I have seen, and probably others,
where money has waved experience to one side,
and insisted upon this or that, where a pliant
architect has obeyed, and they are both useless.
There is such a thing&mdash;it was discovered in these
cases&mdash;as having a stable too big, and of attempting
to house too many horses under one roof.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pn center">FEEDING AND STABLE MANAGEMENT</p>

<p class="pn p2">Experience has shown that one man can care
for three horses; that two men can care for seven;
three men are needed for ten, and so on. But
even this must be modified. Where the members
of the family live in the country and do most of
their own driving, these figures are correct, but in
an establishment where two men are required on
the box with one or more vehicles, and a groom
must accompany each trap, and there is, to boot, a
fair amount of riding, additional help is needed in
the stable, if everything is to go smoothly; and
horses, harnesses, saddles, and carriages are to be
turned out well.</p>

<p>The whole problem of the care and system of a
stable centres around the horse, and more particularly
the horse's stomach. No animal, in proportion
to its size, has such a small stomach as a
horse. The stomach of a man, whose weight is
one-eighth of that of a horse, will hold something
more than three quarts of water; while the stomach
of a horse will only hold three gallons, or four
times that quantity. The great bulk of the horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
requires a large quantity of food, and what food
he eats digests and passes through him quickly.
If this were not so, the stomach would for a large
part of the time be so distended and so press
upon other organs of the body that his usefulness
would be seriously impaired.</p>

<p>He must, therefore, be fed regularly and often,
that is to say, three times a day at least, and four
times is better. The management of the stable
must hinge, therefore, upon the meal hours of its
inmates and their use by the owners&mdash;where
horses must do duty at an early train in the morning
and another train in the evening, or where
horses are out shopping from 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> to 1.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
and there is driving and riding in the afternoon,
and night duty as well, the routine of the stable
must be adapted to those demands.</p>

<p>In the case of a large stable, where three or four
men are kept, a regular routine of duty should be
laid out as on shipboard, with hours and duties
clearly set down, otherwise confusion will reign.
In a small stable the requirements of the family
should be so far as possible along regular lines,
and in all cases everywhere no coachman or
groom ought to be subjected to calls for horses
without warning. By nine o'clock in the morning
the orders for horses wanted up to noon
should be given; by two o'clock the orders for
horses wanted up to eight o'clock. This cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
be done always, but it ought to be done so far
as possible, otherwise the best-natured and most
systematic man in the world will find it impossible
to keep his stable running smoothly, his
horses fed and watered and dressed at the proper
times, and, most important of all, his horses ready
for work when they are needed.</p>

<p>A horse just watered, or with a stomach full of
hay, or with a hearty feed in him, is perhaps the
most uncomfortable of all conveyances, and if
worked hard under the circumstances does himself
serious injury.</p>

<p>There is no real pleasure, no real sport, in this
world that does not entail intelligence and labor.
It is one of the greatest of pleasures, one of the
most wholesome sports, to own, to ride, and to
drive horses. But to have a stable of, say, from
three to ten horses and to get your own fun out
of it, requires work, intelligence, and oversight.</p>

<p>Visit your friends who have horses and see how
often this horse cannot go out, that horse cannot
go out. One is lame, another has a sore back,
another is used up from yesterday, and so on.
Or look about you at the condition of your neighbors'
horses,&mdash;tired-looking, staring coats, bags
of bones to look at, rattling carriages and ill-fitting
harnesses, interfering, and overreaching;
and these establishments cost money and are supposed
to give pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>How shall we avoid all this? If you have no
interest in your stable and have no time, say half
an hour a day, to devote to it, and no other member
of the family knows or cares anything about
it, by all means job your horses and do not
attempt a stable. At least you can avoid being
<i>particeps criminis</i> in the ruining of horses, the
spoiling of coachmen and grooms, and the wasteful
destruction of harnesses and carriages.</p>

<p>But if you have a stable, look after it. Provide
yourself with a Stable Book; a long-leaved book of
a hundred and fifty pages,&mdash;the left-hand page
with the month at the top and thirty-one spaces
below for days of the month. At the top as headings
have Feed&mdash;Shoeing&mdash;Repairs&mdash;Cash&mdash;Miscellaneous.
On the right-hand page have
blank space for Remarks and any details about
horses, veterinary visits, horses bought or sold.
The coachman should enter against the proper
dates what horses are shod and how, what feed
comes in, all articles, including clothes, purchased,
and all other details. This book comes in at the
end of the month, to be compared with the
owners' bills, and he should add the amounts and
check off the items. Both the coachman and the
owner should know to a penny what the stable is
costing.</p>

<p>We have all probably discovered that we do
not know where to save, if we do not know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
we spend. The beginning of all economy is the
knowledge of expenditures. It may be maintained
just here that all this is too much trouble!
Those who feel that way had best close the book.
Neither this chapter nor any of the others is
written for those who know it all,&mdash;of whom,
alas, there are so many,&mdash;nor for those who
do not wish to know anything which entails
trouble.</p>

<p>The necessary implements for the work of the
stable should be furnished willingly, and buckets,
hose, forks, hangers, clothes, chamois, hooks,
brooms, sponges, should be kept in repair or
renewed. It is a poor plan to economize at the
working end of the stable. One or two horses
or traps less, or a groom less, but let what you
have be good of its kind and be kept good.</p>

<p>Once a week the stable should be washed out,
polished, and dusted, and sprinkled with Sanitas
or some other good disinfectant, and the owner
should, as they say on shipboard, have "quarters."
Look over everything from end to end; if you do
not take that much interest in the matter, it is not
likely that the executive officer at the stable will
retain a very enthusiastic interest in the affairs of
the stable for long. A man with half an eye can
tell, from the horses, harnesses, and vehicles he
sees, whether the owners coöperate with their
coachmen or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>A man should be able to groom a horse thoroughly
in from thirty to forty minutes, and this
work should be done, if possible, away from the
other horses.</p>

<p>A good routine for stable management can
only be worked out by each man for himself, according
to the regular demands upon the stable
from the family, as a basis.</p>

<p>Although horses are kept primarily to work, it
is by no means easy, although of all things most
necessary, that they should have exercise regularly.
Many of the accidents and much of the
illness in most stables arise from irregular exercise
and careless feeding. The average horse
in the private stable should be out two hours a
day, and should do ten miles. With one day's
rest in seven, seasoned horses can do more than
this&mdash;up to fifteen, and even more, miles a day&mdash;and
be the better for it.</p>

<p>Their muscles harden, respiratory organs are
less liable to disease, and, strange as it may sound
to the uninitiated, their feet and legs do better,
even when the work is on hard roads. Swelled
legs, founder, azoturia, colic, and the like are more
often the result of overfeeding and under exercising
than the reverse.</p>

<p>If the feet are washed out when the horse returns
to the stable&mdash;being careful to dry the
legs thoroughly&mdash;and stopped at night with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
sponge or bit of thick felt, these precautions,
with regular exercise and judicious feeding, will
do more than anything else to keep your horses
in condition to go when you want them. Coachmanitis
and groomaturia sometimes interfere with
the owner's wish to use his horses; and where
this malady is of frequent occurrence, a prolonged
holiday is the only remedy.</p>

<p>There are some men who are constitutionally
unfitted to get on with men under them. They
are not necessarily bad men, but, from their golf
caddy to their butlers and secretaries, they are
disliked. One woman will run her house year
after year without friction; another, of the bumptious
variety, will supervise the whole universe,
while her husband, children, and household drift,
growl, and suffer. One man will step aboard a
yacht, and his crew and officers will pull and haul
and quarrel and leave; while another, with the
same men, will have no trouble. The writer has
no prescription to offer for the curing of fussy
wives or bad masters. It is not to be expected
that even the Almighty will create a man who
shall combine the attributes of Oliver Cromwell
and Heinrich Heine. But in this matter of the
management of the stable there are a few rules
worth keeping in mind.</p>

<p>Don't use your influence till you get it!</p>

<p>Don't worry yourself or others about trifles!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>In the vital matters of honesty, sobriety, carefulness,
neatness, be insistent and positive.</p>

<p>Don't put on airs about things of which you
know less than your coachman.</p>

<p>Don't show your damned authority&mdash;as the
Irishman with his pig&mdash;just for the pleasure of
showing it!</p>

<p>Horses, no doubt, lived upon grasses and the
like when they cared for themselves. Horses
even now can do a certain amount of slow work
upon hay alone, but to do this a large quantity is
needed, say from eighteen pounds to twenty
pounds. But by a mixture of food a horse can
be made to do more and faster and more exhausting
work.</p>

<p><i>Hay</i>&mdash;good hay&mdash;is short, fine, agreeable to
smell and taste, hard and crisp, and is generally
mixed with clover, and the best hay is one year
old&mdash;is the basis of all feeding. An average
allowance is about twelve pounds a day, with
the larger quantity given at night. A little hay
also at noon helps digestion. If a horse is
wanted for fast work, eight pounds of hay is
enough. A horse does his work more comfortably
to himself if his stomach is somewhat empty
rather than distended with hay. The feeding
of the hay should be regulated so that the animal
is not given his hay just before going to work,
but at the meal after he comes in. Many coachmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
are great believers in chopped hay or chaff.
There is not much saving in feeding hay in this
way&mdash;none at all if it is bought already in the
form of chaff&mdash;although a little chaff mixed with
the other food requires more time in mastication
and hence is better for digestion. Hay should be
fed from the bottom of the stall.</p>

<p><i>Oats</i>&mdash;good oats are heavy, thin-skinned,
clean, hard and sweet, and without musty smell.
Good oats will weigh from 42 to 45 pounds to
the bushel; fair oats, 38 to 40 pounds. Horses
in average work should have from eight to ten
quarts of oats a day. Where the work of the
horses is severe, they should have as much
as they want. The cavalry allowance is
ten quarts a day, which is a good medium
allowance. The rations of oats should be increased
or decreased according to the amount of
work the horse is doing. Oats may be boiled or
steamed, may be flavored with ginger or a little
"black jack" molasses, or even mixed with a few
slices of apples for nervous or bad feeders. If a
horse gobbles his feed, it is well to sprinkle his
oats with dry bran, or to mix them with chaff.</p>

<p><i>Barley</i>, <i>beans</i>, <i>peas</i>, are not much used in private
stables, though beans for a horse in hard
work or for fattening are valuable. A quart of
crushed beans mixed with the other food at night
is recommended. They should be at least a year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
old, weigh from 60 to 64 pounds to the bushel,
and be hard, plump, and sweet.</p>

<p><i>Corn</i> is used largely in the West for horses, but
seldom in the East, in private stables. It is a
strong, fattening food, and, served to the horses
on the ear, is good for teeth and gums, and makes
them eat slowly. It should not be fed in quantity,
but as a change, or a cob or two at a time
with other food.</p>

<p><i>Bran</i>&mdash;should be dry, sweet-tasting, free from
mould&mdash;is not exactly an article of food. It may
be fed with other feed, but is usually given once
or twice a week in the form of a mash, preferably
the night before a day of light work or no work
at all.</p>

<p><i>Linseed</i> is an aperient, like bran, and is used
to moisten food that is too constipating, and is
recommended strongly by some authorities in the
form of a mash mixed with bran or as a jelly in
the case of horses out of condition and needing a
palatable stimulant. It is also conducive to
glossiness of coat and healthiness of skin, but
unless used sparingly affects the wind.</p>

<p><i>Apples</i>, <i>boiled potatoes</i>, <i>carrots</i>, <i>black molasses</i>,
<i>clover</i>, or other <i>fresh forage</i> may all be used
as a change of diet. This last should be given
sparingly at first, for it is often the cause of
serious trouble when given in quantity all at once.</p>

<p><i>Carrots</i> are altogether the best substitute for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
fresh grass. They can be given without harm,
occasionally, the year round, either alone or
mixed with other food&mdash;always cut up lengthwise,
otherwise the horse may choke on them.</p>

<p>Remember, always, the smallness of the horse's
stomach in feeding him. When left to himself,
he will graze all day long, eating, however, but
little at a time. When he comes in tired, give
him a little food, a mash or gruel, or, if he is to
have a hard day, carry a little oatmeal and a
bottle of Bass for his luncheon. If you are
caught far from home with a tired horse, almost
any house can furnish oatmeal, warm water, and,
if procurable, a small amount of stimulant added,
and this, with a good rubbing down, will make
another horse of your tired beast.</p>

<p>Though the stomach of the horse is small,
his water capacity is large. The water he drinks
does not remain in the stomach, but passes
directly through it, and the small intestines to
the cæcum (one of the large intestines). Except
where a horse is ill, overheated, or overtired,
he may be allowed to drink as much as he will.
Horses should always, too, be watered <i>before</i> they
are fed, for reasons obvious from what has been
said of the horse's stomach. Horses should be
watered the last thing at night, say 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> No
horse should be tortured by being kept without
water from 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> till 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> This is cruelty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
soon tells on the horse to his great and very
perceptible disadvantage. Even horses coming
in from work in warm weather may have a small
quantity, but only a small quantity, of water while
they are being cooled out and rubbed down. No
overheated, tired horse should be allowed to fill
himself up with cold water; neither, on the
other hand, should he be kept in a raging thirst
indefinitely.</p>

<p><i>Salt</i> is so necessary a part of the horse's diet
that it is best to have a piece of rock salt weighing
two or three pounds always in his manger,
rather than to leave it to his feeders to give him
so much at each meal, which often results in an
irregular supply.</p>

<p>Express companies and other large owners
and users of horses have been experimenting
with molasses as a food. It has been used, too,
in both the French and German armies. One
quart of molasses, three quarts of water, one
and one-half pounds of corn meal, one and one-half
pounds of bran, and six pounds of cut hay,
is the proper mixture for one horse, and should
be fed morning and evening, with some dry oats
at noon. This is, of course, very much cheaper
than the usual methods of feeding, and in a number
of cases has proved successful. The writer
has seen horses fed upon this diet; they did the
slow and heavy work in large brewers' wagons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and looked sleek and well, and were said to do
their work as well if not better than on the old
system of feeding. It is difficult to use molasses
in private stables, particularly in summer, when
it attracts flies and sours when left in the
manger, but it is a good adjunct to the bill of
fare in any stable, and anything that gives variety
and is wholesome is valuable as a food.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pn center">FIRST AID TO THE INJURED</p>

<p class="pn p2">It is a dangerous thing for owners to doctor
their own horses, unless they are practically veterinarians
by experience, or profession. It is
even more dangerous to leave such matters to
the man in the stable. An omniscient coachman
can do more harm to his cattle than all
other evil surroundings combined. To treat a
horse for a wrongly diagnosed malady, with half-understood
remedies, is the height of folly and
the acme of cruelty.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are certain simple
remedies and certain familiar maladies, of which
the horse-owner ought to know something for his
own, and his horse's protection.</p>

<p>The range of pulse per minute in a healthy
adult horse is from thirty-four to thirty-eight.
In disease the range is from as low as twenty
to as high as one hundred and twenty. The fore
and middle finger should be placed transversely
on the artery inside of the jaw, near the jowl, to
feel the pulse. Do this often when your horses
are in health, and thus accustom yourself to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the pulse instantly and to note its pulsations
accurately in time of need.</p>

<p>The average temperature of the horse is
100° F., a third more or less. The temperature
of the horse is taken by the insertion of
a clinical thermometer in the rectum, where
it should remain five minutes. Horses registering
a temperature as high as 106° have recovered,
but above this death generally ensues.
Nursing, in cases where the ordinary ailments
are concerned, is better than blistering and firing,
which are more spectacular and to the half-ignorant
more popular.</p>

<p>Good laxative foods are green grass, green
wheat, oats, or barley, carrots, parsnips, bran
mash, linseed tea, hay tea, and linseed oil.</p>

<p>A gallon of gruel may be made from a pound
of meal put into cold water, placed on the fire
and stirred till boiling, and then allowed to
simmer till the water is thick.</p>

<p>A <i>bran mash</i> should be made in a clean bucket;
three pounds of bran, one ounce of salt, two pints
and a half of boiling water, covered and allowed
to stand twenty minutes or so till it is cooked.</p>

<p><i>A Bran and Linseed Mash.</i>&mdash;Boil one pound
of linseed slowly for two hours or more, add two
pounds of bran, one ounce of salt; the whole to
be stirred up and allowed to steam. The thicker
the mash, the better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Linseed Tea.</i>&mdash;Boil one pound of linseed in
two gallons of water until the grains are soft.</p>

<p><i>Hay Tea.</i>&mdash;Fill a clean bucket with clean hay,
then pour on as much boiling water as the bucket
will hold, then cover and allow to stand till cool,
when the liquid may be strained off and used.</p>

<p><i>Linseed oil</i>, from a quarter to half a pint daily
may be mixed with the other food, keeps the
bowels and skin in good condition; but no artificial
stimulant as food should be used constantly.</p>

<p>In weakening diseases or low fever, or in cases
of severe exhaustion, a quart of ale or porter, or a
pint of port or sherry, may be given mixed with
the mash. Oatmeal and ale are easy to carry,
and a palatable mash can be made quickly of these
with a little warm water almost anywhere, and
nothing will help out a tired horse more.</p>

<p><i>Common cold</i> is an inflammation of the mucous
membrane lining the nostrils and air passages.
Symptoms are loss of appetite, staring coat, tendency
to sweat easily, and discharge from the
nostrils. Treatment: removal to loose box, plenty
of fresh air, well blanketed if cold weather, bandages
for the legs, laxative diet, green food, warm
mashes instead of oats, and plenty of water. If
the irritation and cough continue and the running
at the nose is bad, the head may be steamed by
holding it over a pail of hot water. If the horse
becomes and continues feverish, a dose of one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
two drams of nitrate of potash may be given daily
for two or three days. Where the cold is accompanied
by sore throat and difficulty of swallowing,
give nitrate of potassium, one dram to half a
bucket of water three times a day. A good liniment
to use on the throat and to be well rubbed in
is mustard and water rubbed on and allowed to
remain half an hour and then washed off, or two
parts linseed oil, one part turpentine, and one part
solution of ammonia.</p>

<p><i>Colic</i> is caused by bad food, change of diet,
sudden exposure. The horse gives evidence of
spasmodic pain, turns his head toward his flank,
bites and kicks, and even rolls. As an immediate
remedy, give a pint of gruel with two ounces spirit
of nitrous ether, one ounce tincture of opium, and
half an ounce of aromatic spirits of ammonia.
There should be relief within the hour; if not,
repeat the dose, and use oil and warm water as
an injection.</p>

<p><i>Diarrhœa</i>, in the form of scouring, may be a
natural effort to get rid of some obnoxious substance.
Horses that are not well "ribbed up"
or of a nervous temperament are prone to it.
Feed dry food after giving a laxative of half a
pint of raw linseed oil. Give an infusion of
gentian, one ounce, and one to two ounces tincture
of opium.</p>

<p><i>Worms.</i>&mdash;Several kinds of worms are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
in the horse's intestines, but the most common
is the bony white worm tapering at both ends.
The horse loses condition in spite of a voracious
appetite. After a fast of twelve hours, give a
dose of two ounces of turpentine in a pint of
linseed oil with half an ounce of tincture of
opium. Injections of a weak solution of salt
serve to clear away the smaller worms that
inhabit the rectum. Change of food and salt
are good.</p>

<p><i>Irregular Teeth.</i>&mdash;The molars sometimes grow
into sharp edges. The horse feeds badly, "hogs"
on one side of his mouth in driving, and shows
sometimes signs of inflammation in the mouth.
The remedy is the simple one of having the teeth
filed down smooth and even.</p>

<p><i>Scratches.</i>&mdash;A very common condition of the
skin in the hollow of the heel, sometimes called
"cracked heels." It is caused by exposure to wet,
cold, and dirt The skin is inflamed and dry and
a watery discharge exudes. Keep the parts dry
and clean, wash with warm water and Ivory soap.
Dust with powdered alum three times a day. Or
apply a dressing composed of one part of carbolic
acid to twenty of oil or glycerine and keep there
with a soft bandage around the pastern and heel.</p>

<p><i>Wounds and bruises</i>, whether the skin is
broken or not, should be carefully bathed in warm
water, three parts of carbolic acid to one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
of water. Warm linseed poultices may then be
applied. In all serious cases of this kind little
more can be done than to relieve the animal till
the veterinarian comes. In minor casualties, as
cases of sprained tendons, bruises, and the like, a
cooling antiseptic wash is: four ounces of witch-hazel,
two ounces of spirits of camphor, two
ounces of tincture of opium mixed in an equal
amount of water.</p>

<p><i>Splints.</i>&mdash;Probably eighty per cent of horses
have splints and not over five per cent remain
lame from them. A splint is an enlargement or
horny excrescence of a part of the shank bone.
It is more common in young than old horses.
Splints caused by striking in action, on the contrary,
are ample cause for judging a horse unsound.</p>

<p>When a splint begins forming, shave off the
hair about it and rub in an ointment of biniodide
of mercury for three days, then apply a strong
blister. The best blister is composed of one
ounce powdered Spanish flies, one ounce powdered
resin, four ounces of lard. Mix the lard and resin,
and then add the Spanish flies. After blistering
a horse, his head must be tied up for forty-eight
hours at least, to prevent his getting at the irritated
part.</p>

<p><i>Shoe boils</i> are usually caused by the pressure
of the shoe when the horse lies down. The boil
should be opened and drained and a three per
cent solution of zinc sulphate injected. The
horse must then wear a shoe-boil boot at night.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>Nail in the Foot.</i>&mdash;Remove the nail and pare
the wound as near the bottom as possible, disinfect
with a solution of carbolic acid, one in thirty,
then linseed poultice the foot for two or three
days and let the foot be shod with oakum and a
leather sole till healed. An old-fashioned remedy
is to apply a piece of salt pork, flesh side in, and
bandage it on the part.</p>

<p><i>Chafing, Collar, and Saddle Galls.</i>&mdash;Properly
fitting harness and saddles is the preventive. A
mild astringent wash, say four ounces witch-hazel,
two ounces spirits of camphor, two ounces tincture
of opium, will serve, and the part to be without
pressure or rubbing till healed. For inflamed
legs or galled shoulders another excellent wash
is: one ounce of sal ammoniac, seven ounces of
vinegar, two ounces of spirits of wine, two drams
of tincture of arnica mixed in half a pint of water.</p>

<p><i>Broken knees</i> should be thoroughly cleansed
and disinfected with a solution of carbolic. Hot
fomentations are good, and the wound should be
dressed with burned alum or with alum and boracic
acid in equal parts dissolved in water.</p>

<p><i>Laminitis or Foot Founders.</i>&mdash;Remove the
shoes, place the feet in hot water for an hour,
poultice twice a day for four or five days. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
horse is without exercise, give him a gentle purgative,
half to a quart of linseed oil, two drams of
ginger, one dram nux vomica as a drench, then
four ounces of nitrate of potash and four drams
gentian, known as founder powder, daily.</p>

<p><i>Chills</i>, after violent exertion when the horse is
unfit for work, or from undue exposure. Clothe
warmly, rub ears and legs, and give stimulants,
one and one-half ounce spirits of nitrous ether,
one-half ounce aromatic spirits of ammonia to one
pint of water, is a valuable remedy in any case of
prostration.</p>

<p><i>Strained or bruised tendons</i>,&mdash;first hot fomentations,
then a cooling lotion, such as vinegar and
water; or two ounces witch-hazel, two ounces spirits
of camphor, two ounces laudanum; or four ounces
acetate of ammonia, four ounces spirits of wine,
eight ounces water.</p>

<p><i>Lameness</i> had best be left for diagnosis to the
expert, unless the lameness is the result of injury
and the seat of the trouble plainly visible. Firing
and blistering should be a last resort.</p>

<p>Do not expect too much of the veterinary;
except in simple cases their task is often a blind
one. The best way to save trouble is to begin
at the beginning, by studying the horse, the
stable, the food, and the care of the horses yourself;
and this elementary knowledge, with careful
handling when the horses are in harness or under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
saddle, make the best "ball," "drench," "lotion,"
or "fomentation" known.</p>

<p>It is not intended in this chapter to suggest
more than can be understood and carried out by
an intelligent man, with a few simple and non-dangerous
remedies.</p>

<p><i>Rice-water gruel</i>, made thick, is a soothing drink,
and useful in continued scouring or diarrhœa.</p>

<p><i>Alcohol</i> is to be rubbed into the skin of horses
who are apt to chafe easily under harness or
saddle. It hardens the skin.</p>

<p><i>Vinegar and water</i> is a cooling lotion.</p>

<p><i>Fomentation</i> means the continued application
of hot cloths wrung out to the injured part.</p>

<p><i>Purgative</i>, a popular purgative is composed of
eight parts of aloes, two parts of glycerine, one
part powdered ginger, well-mixed and given in a
dose of from six to eight drams.</p>

<p><i>Linseed oil</i> is also a purgative and less irritating
than aloes; the dose is from ten to thirty
ounces.</p>

<p><i>Stimulant</i>, one ounce aromatic spirits of ammonia,
one ounce tincture of gentian, one pint of
water. Useful in all cases of severe prostration.</p>

<p><i>Tonics.</i>&mdash;The mineral tonics had best be left to
the veterinary. A quart of good ale warmed and
two drams of grated ginger is a simple cordial
drench. A safe vegetable tonic is two ounces of
tincture of gentian in a pint of water. A good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
tonic powder is: two drams of gentian, two drams
of ginger, one-half dram of fenugreek.</p>

<p>For <i>acidity of the stomach</i>, and to prevent tendency
to colic, a tablespoonful of bicarbonate of
soda, powdered gentian, powdered ginger, mixed
in equal parts and sprinkled over the feed, is
harmless and a valuable minor tonic.</p>

<p>To cool a horse quickly and effectively, dash
water between the fore legs, between the hind
legs, over the head, and down the back or spine.
An overheated, almost prostrated, horse may
often be saved serious if not fatal trouble in
our hot climate by a bath of this kind. In private
stables, water is seldom used, except on the
feet, to wash out the mouth, eyes, sheath, and
anus, and on the legs of white or gray horses.
But this should not be taken as the article of a
creed. A bath, or shampoo, all over does no
horse harm, and all horses good, in our hot
climate, if precautions are taken to dry them
thoroughly and close the pores if necessary by
a rub-down with alcohol. In cases of actual sunstroke,
souse the horse well, all over with water,
if possible from a hose, and an easily prepared
remedy is: an ounce of aromatic spirits of ammonia,
two ounces of whiskey in half a pint of water&mdash;give
this every hour, till the horse is relieved.</p>

<p><i>Flexible collodion</i> is a valuable remedy in any
stable. In case of wounds or cuts that do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
need sewing, shave the hair about the cut, cleanse
carefully, and apply the collodion with a camel's-hair
brush; this will keep the edges together,
and in minor wounds no other remedy is
necessary.</p>

<p><i>Iodoform</i> is one of the very best antiseptics
for either man or beast, and may be dusted
on wounds; or two parts of iodoform and eight
parts of cosmoline make an ointment that may
be a more convenient way of applying it.</p>

<p>The well-known "white lotion" for bruises,
sprains, inflammation, sore backs, shoulders, or
any part of the animal rubbed by the harness
or saddle, or by accident is: one ounce acetate of
lead, one ounce sulphate of zinc mixed in a quart
of water, to be used as a lotion. <i>Nitrate of potassium</i>
is useful when you wish to promote the action
of the skin and kidneys or to reduce fever.
It should be given dissolved in the drinking-water
in doses of from two drams to an ounce three
times a day. It is the most valuable remedy
known in cases of <i>founder</i>, and may be given in
doses of from two to three ounces three times a
day, and may be continued without danger for two
or three days.</p>

<p><i>Salicylic acid</i> is another remedy, equally good
for man or beast, as an antiseptic to be dusted
upon wounds and indolent sores, proud flesh: for
rheumatism, one dram of the salicylic acid with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
two drams of bicarbonate of soda, given twice a
day, is as good as anything.</p>

<p>But when all is said and done on this subject,
it must be repeated again and again that, regularity
as to time, and variety as to fodder in feeding,
plenty of water, regular exercise, peace and
quiet during rest hours, a dry stable, thorough
grooming, the eye of the master, and the interest
of the man in the stable,&mdash;these taken daily in
large doses make the best prescription in the
world for the continued health and usefulness of
your horses.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pn center">SHOEING</p>

<p class="pn p2">The shoeing of horses was not known to the
earliest users of horses. It is true the Romans
used a sort of leather sock, with an iron plate
beneath, and the extravagant Poppæa, the wife of
Nero, had gold plates on her favorite horses, as
wives of similar traditions to-day, have silver
bath-tubs and satin sheets.</p>

<p>When the monument to Childeric, the father of
Clovis, the founder of the French monarchy, was
discovered in 1653, a horseshoe was found therein.
It was the custom then, as at one time among our
own Indians, to bury the horse and his owner together.</p>

<p>Polydore Vergil writes, "Hos quoque Pelethronios
Thessaliae primos equorum ungulas
munire ferreis soleis coepisse ferunt."</p>

<p>As we have related in another chapter, William
the Conqueror shod his horses.</p>

<p>The horse's foot is so apparently the most important
part of him to his owner, that every horse
owner should at least know the elementary first
principles of the formation and shoeing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
foot and should always bear in mind, "no foot
no horse." The foot is a sensitive structure, with
two bones and part of the third, viz. the coffin-bone,
navicular or shuttle bone, and the lower or
smaller pastern bone enclosed in a horny case.
This case is deepest in front where it is called the
toe, and shallower at the sides which are called
the quarters, and narrowest behind where it is
called the heel. This outer case is fibrous, the
fibres running from above to below as they grow
from where the skin terminates, and consists of
the outer case or wall and the bars, which are the
continuation of the crust under the foot, and between
the triangle of which lies the frog. (Plate
XIX.)</p>

<p>The horse, as a wild animal left to care for
himself, had a beautiful cushion, the frog, to run
on, protected by the horny, tough case and bars,
which renew themselves as do the nails of a man.</p>

<p>Hard roads, heavy weights to carry and to pull,
and confinement in stables developed shoeing as
a necessity.</p>

<p>Very few men own their horses; the horses are
generally, except for a legal right which is a
formality, the property of the coachmen and the
blacksmith. They dictate when, and how, and
how far they shall go, and the owner for lack of a
little study of the subject accepts their say-so.</p>

<p class="p2">The feet of a horse do not wear out, as do his
teeth, for instance. An old horse may have,
barring accident, just as good feet as a young
one. Nature has provided amply for the renewal
of the frog and the sole and the crust of the
horse's hoof. But in order that this renewal
should not be interfered with, the foot should be
kept clean, moist, and well shod. As the foot is
kept on hard substances in and out of the stable,
and not as nature intended in contact with the
moist ground, this moisture should be supplied
artificially by stopping the feet once or twice a
week. If the foot is not cleaned each time the
horse comes in, the tender frog and sole become
diseased; if the frog and sole are not moistened,
but kept dry, the frog and sole crack,
chip, and fail to renew themselves properly; if
shoes too big or too small, or shoes that do not
fit the crust and bars are put on, or if nails are
put in carelessly or pulled out roughly, the foot
contracts, corns appear, and you have a lame, an
unnecessarily lame, horse on your hands. The
fore feet are nearly circular in a healthy horse, the
hind feet more oval in form.</p>

<p>It is no economy not to shoe horses at least
every three or four weeks, whether the shoes
are worn out or not; for the simple reason that
the shoes are nailed to a substance which is
always growing, and after that interval of time the
shoe no longer fits the foot. The shoe should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
made and put on to fit the foot, and no blacksmith
should be allowed to rasp the foot down to
fit the shoe. The crust or wall of the foot is
about three-quarters of an inch wide in most
horses, and this is the proper width for the shoe,
and the shoe to be flat toward the foot. If the
shoe is wider, as is often the case,&mdash;go over your
horse's feet and see,&mdash;it leaves a little shelf for
stones and dirt, and a horse going in wet, heavy
ground may even have his shoes pulled wholly
off by suction. The shoes should be as wide as
this crust to the heels, but where the crust narrows
at the juncture with the bars, the shoe should
narrow too.</p>

<p>For the ordinary horse for riding or driving,
neither a racer nor a hunter, a shoe may weigh
from nine to fourteen ounces. It is to be remembered
in this connection, that shoes grow rapidly
lighter as they get thinner from wear. This
should be considered in deciding upon the
weight of a horse's shoes. Big work horses are
sometimes shod with shoes weighing five, six,
and seven pounds. As few nails as possible to
make the shoe secure is best&mdash;five to seven is
enough. As the inside of the crust of the hoof
is always thinner and more elastic than the outside
on account of the greater weight it bears,
contraction is generally found on the inside; use
two nails inside and three outside, or three inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and four outside, if seven are necessary. The
outside crust is thicker and stronger than the
inside crust of the heel and affords more nailhold.
No matter what the blacksmith or the
coachman&mdash;who is often only his echo&mdash;says,
insist that the bars of the horse's feet shall on no
account be cut away. The wall of the hoof is not
only much weakened by this operation, but the
hoof must, in consequence of it, contract toward
the heel. The reason advanced for doing this is
that it allows room for expansion, when as a matter
of fact, with the bars cut away, there is nothing to
keep the foot open, and there follow contraction
and corns. Corns mean lameness, a timid way of
putting the feet down, and hence stumbling, and
corns are very difficult to get rid of. Look at the
healthy foot of a horse and see for yourself that
this must be so, and then have your horses shod
as though they really belonged to you. Remember
that most blacksmiths shoe the horse to look
well on the outside. It should be your business
to insist that he be so shod that the hoof shall
keep well on the inside!</p>

<p>To discuss different styles of shoes, questions
of balancing horses for speed or action, would
require a treatise by itself.</p>

<p>It is fair to condense advice on the subject by
saying that the lightest and closest-fitting shoe that
will suit the work and the peculiarities of moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of the horse will be the best for him. Do not
allow paring of the sole and frog; have light shoes
properly fitted; use as few nails as possible; make
the shoe to fit the foot, and permit no rasping,
burning, and paring to fit the foot to the shoe;
do not allow the front of the hoof to be rasped.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten in this matter of shoeing
that there are no muscles below the knee
and the hock, and the muscles used to move
the legs are high up. What weighs little at the
shoulder or stifle weighs very much more at the
end of the leg. Take a stick three feet long and
put a pound-weight on it next your hand, then
transfer the pound-weight to the end of the
stick next the ground, and you see for yourself
the difference. Or suppose in fencing you put
a weight equal to the handle, where the button is,
and the difference in using the weapon is enormous.
A horse shod with shoes unnecessarily
heavy is at just that disadvantage; therefore it is
of the utmost importance both for his comfort
and your safety that he should be shod as lightly
as is compatible with the work required of him.
In fitting the shoe, great care should be taken
that both sides of the hoof are of the same height.
If they are not of the same height, the whole foot
is thrown out of plumb; this twists the delicate
joints of leg and pastern and leads to disease.
In the majority of cases that I have noticed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the inside of the foot is left higher than the
outside.</p>

<p>The horse left without shoes does not suffer
from corns, thrush, "speedy-cut," sand-cracks,
quittor, and the like. On the contrary, he develops
and keeps in condition a foot wonderfully
well adapted to carry him and hold him. He
has a wonderful cushion to run on and take the
jar off, enclosed in a fibrous case of horn. The
care of the foot and the shoeing thereof should
leave as much to nature and as little to the blacksmith
as possible. Artificial conditions make iron
shoes necessary, but except for the heaviest kind
of work on the roughest and hardest roads the
less shoe, the fewer nails, and the less paring and
rasping of the foot, the better. The cavalry in
this country do not shoe the horses on the hind
feet unless special service requires it.</p>

<p>Where a horse interferes or forges, certain
changes in his shoeing may help matters. In
interfering, unless it arises from bad malformation,
the height of the shoe may be increased on
the inside, or a three-quarter shoe used on the
outside; or, if this fails, the exact opposite may
be tried. The so-called Charlier shoe, which fits
into a bevelled hollow around the crust, suits
some horses.</p>

<p>Clicking or forging arises from the striking of
the toe of the hind shoe against the under edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of the toe of the fore shoe. It results usually
from the quicker action of the hind quarters than
the fore quarters. A remedy is to shorten the
toes of the hind feet and level off the edges of
the toe of the fore shoe. Shortening the toes of
the fore feet enables the horse to raise his fore
feet more quickly and thus to get them away
before the hind quarters reach his fore feet. In
hilly country, or where horses are overworked
or weakened by illness, this overreaching is most
common, and often disappears when horses get
accustomed to the country, or get stronger and
better able to lift, and to carry their feet properly.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pn center">HARNESS</p>

<p class="pn p2">The harness has two fundamental functions:
first, to attach the horse to the vehicle, so that he
may pull it; second, to enable the coachman to
guide the horse. The elements of all harness,
therefore, are: the collar, hames, and traces, and
the bridle, bit, and reins.</p>

<p>The pulling part&mdash;the collar, hames and traces&mdash;should,
of course, be first of all strong and then
as light as will fulfil their purpose; the guiding
part&mdash;the bridle, bit, and reins&mdash;should first of
all be light, but strong enough to hold the horse.
Whether you buy harness, or use harness, or wish
to be guided in examining and keeping in repair
your own harnesses, these are the underlying
principles of the whole subject.</p>

<p>All questions of form or fads or personal
peculiarity must first conform to these principles,
otherwise the harnessing will be wrong. From
judging the appointment classes at a horse
show to the buying of a harness for your children's
pony, these first principles of what a harness
should be apply rigidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Unless there is a rational basis to go upon in
all these matters, form and style and so on are
mere silliness. As an example of this, there is
the absurd dictum in this country that a lady
should sit on the right side of her own carriage,
due, of course, to the fact that in England vehicles
pass to the left, which of course makes the right
side the prominent side. In this country vehicles
pass to the right, which of course makes the
left side the prominent, and, for purposes of seeing
and being seen, the more convenient side. This
is a very happy illustration of vehicular toadyism,
or of so-called "form," which is simian, rather
than sensible. Wherever, therefore, in the matter
of manners and appointments on the road, from
the harnessing, furnishing, and handling of a
pony cart to a "drag," you are met with a statement
or given advice that has no rational
sanction, be sure you are wrong and investigate
further.</p>

<p>A similar question to the above is the much-mooted
one as to whether the reins, particularly
in four-in-hand driving, should be buckled or left
unbuckled. When the mail-coaches were making
the best time possible from stage to stage or when
the amateur whip was making the best time possible
in imitation thereof, it was claimed that a certain
amount of time was saved at the end of each
stage by doing away with the unbuckling of the
reins. True, time was saved, and with professional
coachmen there was the minimum of danger from
dropping a rein. But nowadays, in driving a
coach, either on the road or in the park, the
safety, comfort, and pleasure of the passengers are
first of all important, and the seconds saved in
unbuckling reins are of no consequence.</p>

<p class="p1">The best road coachman I know in this country,
and a man who probably never dropped a rein in
his life, drives with his reins buckled. As to the
question of the leaders running away, when of
course buckled reins would catch in the terrets of
the wheel horses' pads,&mdash;that is as though a man
should sleep every night in a rope harness for
getting out of windows in case of fire.</p>

<p>These two questions are typical of certain
vapid discussions of questions relating to harness
and harnessing, and they are also typical of how
the student of such matters should settle them.
Usage is the law of language, so, too, usage
should not be dethroned in any department of life
without good reason; but when usage becomes
an empty form, and when a change makes for
safety, comfort, and convenience, there should be
no hesitation about making it.</p>

<p>The earliest form of vehicle and harness, and
upon which all improvements have been built up,
are the Indian pony with two long poles attached
to his belly-band and a rawhide rope around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
his neck. There you have all the elements of a
harness, but with no comfort and no convenience,
and only the most precarious safety. In the
famous picture, "Attila at Rome," by Raphael, the
Huns are riding without bit or bridle, merely a
rope or strap around the neck of their mounts.
In certain pictures of Roman chariots there is
but one rein attached to a snaffle-bit, and the
horse was evidently guided by the pressure of
the rein and the whip; though it is to be remembered
that the complicated turnings of
modern traffic and modern roads were unknown,
and to keep straight, and to start and stop, were
the main thing.</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning in a discussion of modern
harness (Plate XXII.), it is proper to emphasize
the fact that the very best leather is none too
good, whether in your traces or in your reins.
The best leather is made of the hides of heifers
or steers and tanned with oak bark. The total
supply of oak bark in England is only about
three hundred thousand tons a year, which amount
is quite insufficient; and most of the English
leather is tanned by cheaper and quicker methods.
The old oak-tanning process took eighteen
months, and made leather of unequalled quality.
To-day the process hardly consumes as many
weeks, and in America, hemlock bark is the most
important material used.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill416" id="ill416">416</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-416.jpg" width="400" height="270"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">PLATE XXII.&mdash;SINGLE HARNESS</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It is not easy, except by long experience, to tell
good leather at a glance. One authority says
that good leather should "be solid, but not
hard; mellow, but not soft." The black leather
in a harness should have a smooth surface, close
texture, and when bent between the hands should
not show minute cracks.</p>

<p>The collar is the keystone of the pulling part
of the harness. It should fit to a nicety, every
horse having his own collar as much as the coachman
should have his own boots. The collar
should be lined with some non-porous material,
preferably soft leather&mdash;even thin patent leather
is good and easily cleaned. If the collar is too
wide, it will rub the shoulders; if too short, it will
choke the horse; if rounded at the top, it will press
on and gall the withers. Usually the collar that
will go over a horse's head will fit as to width, and
is long enough when four fingers, held vertically,
will go between the collar and neck, when the
head is held in its usual position. The sides of
the upper part of the collar, as well as the sides
over the shoulders, should be well filled out, to
prevent the rubbing of the point of the collar on
the withers. In cases where the horse has an
unusual conformation of head and neck a collar
opening at the top is a convenience&mdash;one or
two such collars should be kept in every stable.
Collars may be either straight or curved back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the latter variety showing off the horse's neck to
advantage.</p>

<p>The hames must, of course, fit the collar; and
the draught-eye in the hames, to which the tug is
attached, should be placed so that the pull comes
upon the muscles of the lower part of the shoulder-blade,
or at a point where this large bone is narrowest.
Usually hame-rings are placed too low by
a full inch on the hames when fitted to the collar.
This is important, as it puts the draught where
the horse can most easily apply most power and
leaves his shoulders as free as though the collar
were not there. The incline of the trace from
the collar, so far as applied mechanics are concerned,
matters little so long as it is not too high
nor too low; but as a wheel meets with friction
and obstructions up and over which it must be
pulled, it is an advantage to have the trace <i>decline</i>
from the collar to the vehicle.</p>

<p>It is well to put the collar on some minutes before
the horse is to be used in it, so that his neck
and shoulders may be warmed for their work;
and it is absolutely essential to sound skin on
neck and shoulders that the collar should be left
on the horse five or ten minutes after his return,
hot from work. Pads or saddles should fit as
well as collars and should be placed just back of
the shoulders, where the muscles are no longer
prominent. If horses were saddled twenty minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
before they were wanted, and only unsaddled&mdash;girths
of course being loosened&mdash;twenty minutes
after their return to the stable, these precautions,
and a liberal use of alcohol rubbed into the
skin, would lessen materially the number of sore
backs. A Dutch collar, or breastplate, is sometimes
used in light harness instead of a neck
collar. In the case of a horse with sore shoulders
this is a convenience, or a horse with graceful
neck and shoulders in the lead of a tandem shows
off better with such a collar. But for draught it
is not as good as the neck collar.</p>

<p>To the hames on the collar is fastened the tug,
to the tug the trace, which at its other end is
fastened finally to the vehicle. Of the length of
tugs and traces it is to be said that they should
be of such length that the back-band lies on the
middle of, not in front or behind, the pad, when
the horse is pulling. The reason for this is that
otherwise the horse will be pulling the vehicle,
not by the trace, but by the back-band. Many
illustrations of this awkwardness may be seen
wherever you see horses in harness.</p>

<p>Of the particular fastenings of tugs to hames,
and of traces to vehicles,&mdash;these must depend
upon the type of vehicle, and had best be left to
the choice of the technically experienced. But
it is every owner's business to see to it that these
draught portions of the harness are strong and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of the proper length. In the case of traces in a
coach harness, the inside trace should be about
half a hole shorter than the outside trace to make
the draught even, and the convenient way to do
this is to wrap the inside roller-bolt with leather,
thus taking up more of the trace on that side, and
saving the weakening of the trace by punching
an extra hole in the tug end of it.</p>

<p>Good, strong, pliable reins, particularly of the
length, 23 feet 6 inches, required for the lead-reins
of a coach, are hard to get, but merit all the time
and money spent in getting them. Of the size,
viz. the width, of the reins, one writer says: "<i>Medio
tutissimus ibis</i>," which back-of-the-dictionary Latin
would apply equally well to a man's gloves or
collars. If you have short fingers, the reins should
be, say, three-quarters or seven-eighths of an inch
wide; if long fingers, one inch wide or even a little
more. A man with short fingers would be hampered,
and his work in fingering four reins would
be cramped, with wide reins.</p>

<p>A horse's bridle should fit him nicely and with
no loose ends hanging or sticking about his head.
Nothing looks more slovenly than trace points
or back-band points or bridle billet ends sticking
out of, and beyond their loops.</p>

<p class="p1">The horse's eyes should come in the middle of
the winkers, and the headstall should be so fitted as
to keep them there. The winkers should not bulge
out nor turn in, and thus almost touch the eye.
Above all, they should not, as is often the case,
drop so that the horse can see over, and behind
them. Many horses under these circumstances
will pay so much attention to the man and the
whip, and perhaps the parasol, behind them, that
they will see nothing else. The throat-latch
should be loose enough to allow three fingers
between it and the throat. It is intended to keep
the whole bridle in place, but not to choke the
horse. The nose-band is a survival. It was
intended to keep the jaws of the horse together
so that he could not relieve himself from the bit
by opening his mouth. In the case of a bit with
a high port it is still useful for that purpose; but
even when used merely because it came as part
of the harness, it should fit and not be a flopping
ring of leather around the horse's nose. A nose-band
properly adjusted should have the width of
two fingers between it and the horse's jaws and
should fit snugly and not too far up over his nose.
The brow-band should so fit that it does not rub
the ears. When the bridle is hung up as one
piece, see that it is not hung on a hook, so that
one side or the other is pulled out of shape, but
on a proper bridle-rack.</p>

<p>Of bits, as of books, there is no end. Xenophon
advises a flexible bit covered with leather.
"No matter what the kind of bit, it must always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
be flexible," he maintains (Plate XXI.). William
Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle, in probably the
most sumptuous book on the horse ever published,
writing in 1657, says, "But above all,
this rule is chiefly to be observed, to put as little
iron in your horse's mouth as possibly you can."</p>

<p>With bits as with shoes, the less and the lighter,
the better, so long as they be strong enough to
hold your horse. The plain snaffle, ring snaffle,
double ring snaffle, Liverpool bit, Elbow bit, Buxton
bit, Swales's patent, and (Plates XXIII. and
XXIV.) innumerable modifications of these, offer
opportunity to shift responsibility from your own
hands to the tender bars of the horse's mouth.
Outside of here and there a horse who, on account
of bad early training or from ill-usage or from
fracture, it is impossible to bit so that he will go
comfortably, the matter of bits and bitting is a
matter of patience and experiment.</p>

<p>Bits are often bought as though any size of bit
would do for any size of horse. But a bit too
large is as injurious as a bit too small. The mouthpiece
should be exactly the width of the mouth,
and if you have not a bit that fits exactly, it is a
simple matter to insert around the mouthpiece and
inside the branch of the bit, a disk of leather of
the thickness required to make your bit fit snugly
(Plates XXV. and XXVI.). This fitting of the
bit alone makes a great difference to the comfort
of the horse, as may be seen by looking closely
at the way in which a bit with the mouthpiece
too long works in the horse's mouth, when attached
to two long reins and pulled this way
and that. The bit should be placed neither too
high nor too low in the mouth, but about an
inch above the tusk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>The curb-chain should allow of two fingers
between it and the horse's jaw. This curb-chain
is a part of the lever which works by the bit,
through the reins, on the mouth, and should be
handled with discrimination and soberly. The
curb-chain may be made more severe, either by
tightening it, or by turning the chain itself so
that it will be with rough edges against the
horse's jaw. It is doubtful whether this is more
than a temporary solution of pulling. Its final
effect is to deaden the horse's mouth. When
you are tempted to tighten your curb-chain,
tighten your nose-band and loosen your curb-chain
instead; or lift the bit by a hole in the
horse's mouth or lower it; or buckle your reins
in the cheek instead of the bar, middle bar, or
lower bar; or if there seems to be trouble on
one side of the horse's mouth and not on the
other,&mdash;if on the near side, put the off rein into
the middle bar, leaving the near rein in the cheek,
or <i>vice versa</i>; or look to see if your horse has
his tongue over the bit; or if he is inclined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
loll with his tongue, tie his tongue down with soft
string; or loosen or tighten the bearing-rein;&mdash;in
short, use every means in your power to make
the horse comfortable before you resort to harsh
measures&mdash;which last, by the way, are almost
never permanently successful.</p>

<p>Above all things, don't lose your temper, and
make matters absolutely impossible of remedy by
doing just what the horse is doing&mdash;pulling!
The horse may be merely nervous, or ignorant
of what the bit means, or really suffering; and
you have more intelligence than he has&mdash;the
comparative weights of your brains and spinal
cords prove it&mdash;and that being true, you should
illustrate this physiological law by managing
him, rather than to permit him to manage you.
But, you reply, what if you have tried everything,
and he still continues to pull your arms out and
endanger the lives of yourself and others? Then
get out of a bad fix as best you can. Telegraph
him that you decline the nomination
as candidate unless he reforms, and get him
back to Nebraska as speedily and with as little
danger as possible.</p>

<p>Anything that can be done to freshen or to
keep fresh the animal's mouth, and to give him
something rather to play with, than to pull
against, is important. Hence the reason for
changing the position of the bit, for movable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
mouthpieces, or for any other device to keep
the horse from taking the bit too seriously.</p>

<p>There are innumerable experiments to be tried
before a horse is to be set down as a "puller."
Often when a horse finds he is not to be hurt,
he goes well enough. Take out the heavy bit,
and drive him in a snaffle. Cover his bit with
rubber, or sew salt pork on his bit; or give him
a bit that works up and down, or change from
the straight bit to one with a slight port, so that
it does not rest on his tongue, or go to your
harness maker and have a Liverpool made with
a jointed mouthpiece,&mdash;why not? What you
want is something not unsightly to drive your
horse in, and, as we have said before, though
"form" and "correctness" are absolutely essential
to persons and things without content, they
are to be set aside always when there is a rational
sanction for doing so. Dress parade at quarters
if you please and without a speck or a spot or a
stir of a muscle; but undershirts and bare feet
for coaling ship and going into action. The
man who is overawed by twaddle about "form"
in the treatment of a live animal, whether man or
beast, must have cur blood in him from some
source, and is not a proper person to be put
in authority over either.</p>

<p>There are many things about the harness
which annoy the horse and make him restive and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
uncomfortable to drive. His brow-band may be
chafing his ears; his winkers may be flapping or
pushing against his eyes; his pad or saddle may
not fit, and be rubbing his backbone; the crupper
may be too short, catching him hard under the
tail or pulling the saddle backward; the traces
may be too long or too short, hampering him in
his work; his shoes may have been on too long
and become too small for his ever growing hoof;
the bearing-rein may be too tight; the bit too
wide, or hard on his tongue, or pressing against
inflamed tissue caused by ragged teeth which
ought to have been filed down.</p>

<p>All these matters, it ought to be the pride, as it
is the duty, of a coachman to look out for. It is
for this reason, if for no other, that the owner of a
horse or horses should know the elements at least
of the history, housing, harnessing, and handling
of the horse. Ignorance not only means discomfort
and danger, but it means cruelty as well.</p>

<p>A martingale is intended to prevent the horse
from throwing up his head. It is looped through
a buckle and attached to the belly-band at one
end; the other end is a split strap with rings
through which the reins pass, or it may be fastened
to the bit itself, or to the nose-band if the horse is
refractory or fussy about his mouth.</p>

<p>The question of bearing-reins is not a question
of bearing-reins or no bearing-reins, but a question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of the use and misuse of bearing-reins. No horse
or pony of spirit should be driven by a woman or
a child without a bearing-rein. It prevents the
animal rubbing his head against shaft or pole,
and catching and perhaps pulling his bridle off;
it prevents him from getting his head down between
his legs and becoming unholdable; and it
makes kicking more difficult. A halter is enough
for Dobbin when Dobbin goes his sleepy way,
but there is no knowing what day in ten years
Dobbin gets well, and devil a saint is he! The
bearing-rein, properly adjusted, does not inconvenience
the horse in the slightest and is a valuable
safeguard in time of need. For a boring or
heavy-headed or gross-necked horse, the bearing-rein
takes weight off the coachman's hands and
helps rather than impedes the horse.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the bearing-rein, like a certain
feminine piece of harness, may be used for
purposes of fashionable distortion. The horse's
head is twisted up high in the air to make him
lift his legs and to give him a lofty and proud
appearance. This use of the bearing-rein is indeed
an abomination. The gag bearing-rein is a
rein passing from a point of the headstall on each
side, through a swivel attached to the snaffle,
thence through another ring, and fastened on to
the hook of the pad or saddle. The sides of the
horse's mouth are drawn up, and with a tight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
crupper to boot, the horse looks as though he
were tied together at the teeth and the tail. One
sees little of this nowadays. Only the very
newest dollars, daubed with unusual ignorance,
permit this turkey-cock style of harnessing.</p>

<p>The crupper, passing from the pad or saddle
and ending in a padded loop under the tail,
holds the saddle from slipping forward when
the harness is without breeching, and also, as a
horse always tucks his tail into his quarters when
about to kick, prevents kicking to some extent.
The crupper should be stuffed with linseed to
keep it moist, and to prevent its hardening and
becoming a worry to the horse.</p>

<p>In these days, when even light carriages have
brakes, breeching is seldom used except with state
or very dressy harness. In a hilly country or with
two-wheeled traps, particularly those driven by
women or children, it should be a part of the
harness. In such cases, safety rather than appearance
or lightness is the essential thing. The
breeching should hang about twelve inches below
the upper part of the dock, and have four to six
inches' play when the horse is in his collar.</p>

<p>The kicking-strap in a single harness is fastened
on one shaft and passes up and over the
horse's quarters through a loop in the crupper and
down on the other side to the other shaft. In double
harness two straps are needed. They are fastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to the pad and run alongside the crupper to the
splinter-bar and are connected by a strap across
the quarters. No advice is necessary here. When
a kicking-strap is needed, the necessity is obvious.
Pains should be taken, however, to have the kicking-strap
well back on the quarters, otherwise it is
valueless, and also to have it loose enough not to
be the cause itself of kicking.</p>

<p>Though the whip is not part of the harness,
it is an important adjunct. The best stocks
are made of holly or of our own white hickory.
The stock should be five feet long, and the thong,
for four horses, ten feet six inches&mdash;for one or
two, four feet long. The balance of the whip to
one who drives much is as important as the
suitable balance of a fishing-rod, golf-club, or
rapier. If badly balanced, it adds a surprising
burden of weight on the hand, to one who has
not experienced it. A good maker's whip will
balance at its best, at the collar; that is to say,
when grasped at the collar it is carried with the
weight most evenly distributed for its holder.
The thong should be kept pliable with mutton
tallow or soap,&mdash;crown soap is the best,&mdash;and
never pipe-clayed, which rots the thong. It
should never be left standing, but, in order to
keep its shape, it should hang, when not in use,
on a spool. Even heavy poles will warp, if not
properly cared for, by keeping them lengthwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
on proper rests; much more true is this of the
far lighter and more delicate whiphandles. The
large or butt end of a good stock will be nine-tenths
of an inch round, the small end six-tenths.
For a heavy whip the handle should be covered
with pigskin, and sewn down its length, or, even
better, wound in a spiral, each fold overlapping,
which makes the handle less slippery in wet
weather; the chief value of pigskin here and
elsewhere in saddlery and harness-making is that
it is not made rough by friction. Imitation pigskin
is made in quantity. In genuine pigskin,
the bristles reach clear through the skin, so
that there are holes on the flesh side. In the
imitations the holes only reach part way through.
The thong on every whip should be of the same
material throughout, and not terminate in whipcord,
or silk, or ribbons, or any other fussy
material. The whip is for use&mdash;important use&mdash;to
a good coachman, and should be made
accordingly.</p>

<p>Of the care of harness, it would be difficult
to say too much. The whole pleasure and safety
of driving depend practically upon the watch
that is kept to see that it is safe and strong.
When there is question about wear, it is better
to replace the worn part at once. Better throw
an old harness aside, than run the risk of its
being used by leaving it in the stable. It may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
be put on in muddy weather, or through carelessness,
and disaster follows. As long as leather
remains dry and clean, it needs little attention.
Once it is wet, it should be carefully cleaned and
well rubbed with oil. Neat's-foot oil is the best.
Vegetable oils, with the single exception of castor-oil,
which is disagreeable by reason of its odor,
are apt to become hard. All brass or plate on
harness tarnishes easily, and should be kept from
the ammonia of the stable and from the fumes
of gas, if it is burned; as well as from gas from the
stove. A good mixture for black harness is one
pint spirits of turpentine, four ounces of beeswax,
one ounce prussian blue, half an ounce lampblack;
after the application, plenty of hand polishing.
It would seem almost unnecessary to warn against
soaking any part of leather harness in water, if
the writer had not seen on more than one occasion
parts of harness literally left to soak in the
water-bucket! In the case of the parts of the
harness made of patent leather, no wax preparation
should be used; vaseline and a soft rag will
do the cleaning sufficiently well.</p>

<p>What has been said of the care of harness
is equally, and for the same reason, of safety,
true of the carriages in your stable. All carriages
profit by an airing occasionally. If they are not
often used, they should be run out and left for an
hour or two in a dry, warm place. Carriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
newly painted and varnished should be washed
several times before they are used. This sets
and hardens paint and varnish.</p>

<p>Carriages should not be merely dusted or
wiped over, but washed when they come in, and
thoroughly dried&mdash;a soft sponge on fine carriages,
a hose on rougher vehicles, and a soft
chamois to dry both, and patience&mdash;never hot
water and never picking off of dried mud, lest
paint and varnish come with it. Carriages
with plain axles should have the axles seen to
after every outing. Men who do much driving
of heavy vehicles with Collinge or Mail axles,
unless they have competent servants or are competent
themselves, find it safer and better to have
the carriage builder look after their axles at regular
intervals. Collinge axles will go from one
to two months; Mail axles a week without oiling,
on a private coach. On public coaches it is
the custom to examine the axles each day.</p>

<p>Washing and caring for carriages is not a difficult
matter, except that the human qualities of
patience and painstaking are more difficult to find
even than mechanical ability. Time should be
taken on the wash-stand, if nowhere else. Of
the care of the cushions and stuffed parts of carriages,
and the metal parts, common sense, and
the well-known commercial pastes sold by all
harness and carriage makers, will fit a man out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
to do his duty. With styles of carriages and appropriate
vehicles for exhibiting and the like, this
book does not deal. The most scientific treatise
on the subject of the coach and carriage is "A
Manual of Coaching," by Fairman Rogers. The
author was of high attainments as an engineer,
and of great practical experience as a coachman.
A valuable book of reference, with complete and
very good illustrations covering the ground of
appropriateness and "good form," is "Driving
for Pleasure," by Francis T. Underhill. A very
useful compilation, very complete and clear as to
all details of the stable is, "The Private Stable,"
by James A. Garland.</p>

<p>All parts of steel, bits, curb-chains, pole-chains,
kidney-links, and the like, after washing, may be
put into lime-water&mdash;dissolving as much common
lime as the water will take; this does steel
no harm and keeps off rust. To polish these
parts, they should be shaken in a bag with fine
sawdust and sand. Sand and emery paper scratch,
and do not burnish satisfactorily; a steel burnisher
is the only way in which the original polish can
be regained or retained.</p>

<p>That harness should be appropriate to the
horse, the vehicle, and the use to which it is to
be put, goes without saying. The pony-cart, the
runabout, the drag, the miniature Victoria, the
station wagon, need harness to suit them. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
this by no means entails different harness for
every vehicle. On the contrary, a few changes,
and a pair of leaders' reins, both for four and
tandem, will fit you out for almost any kind of
driving. Collars, bits, saddles, should fit their
wearers; and of these, if there are many horsemen
and horsewomen in the family, you must
have an adequate supply. But the light pony-pair
harness with long reins, and the heavier harness
if a larger pair fitted with removable terrets, gives
you a four-in-hand harness. A similar arrangement
with two single harnesses will give you a
tandem harness; and it is well to remember that
the greater variety of driving you have, the more
confidence you will gain and the better you will
drive. It is hard on the men in the stable to
have too little harness, and it is a burden to have
a lot of harness that is never used. Leather up to
a certain age improves with use and deteriorates
when left to hang and become dry, so that it is
almost as necessary not to have too much harness
as to have enough. Let it be repeated that any
question of worn parts of a harness should be
investigated and attended to at once. This is
not merely economy; it is gross extravagance not
to do so, and a peril besides.</p>

<p>When men wore close armor and a beaver
down, they could only be distinguished by
emblems on their shields or harness. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
reading was an almost unknown accomplishment,
it was necessary that men should have over their
tents in the field, or over their gates or doors
at home, signs and symbols that could be easily
seen and distinguished. Hence arms and heraldry.
The more conspicuous the man or the family, the
more necessary that he and they should be easily
recognizable. Hence the inns of the local village,
the servants, the carriages, and the like were distinguished
by a particular badge.</p>

<p>The reason for this has passed. The overpowering
instinct in man to prolong his existence,
by having been, by being, and by affirming that
he will be, as shown in genealogy, in ambition
to be well known, and in the belief in immortality,
is the explanation of heraldry. That the army,
navy, or diplomatic officer should put a cockade
in his servants' hats, is therefore not difficult to
understand. That almost every man should wish
to make the best of his ancestry,&mdash;to cut out the
tailors, and hatters, and tinsmiths, and tanners, and
make prominent the worthies,&mdash;is also not difficult
to understand. To the American, however, the
conspicuous use of insignia of this kind, unless
the authenticity thereof be verifiable by proofs
unquestionable, is rather childish. There is no
doubt whatever but that we all have a strain of
the right to bear arms blood; there is also no
doubt that we have all more or less lived through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
days of small and tradesman-like things in this
country, and perhaps your own initials on your
harness are the safest badge. If you are a gentleman,
it will probably show itself most conspicuously
by the fact that you never remind others
of it and never forget it yourself. If either
technically or morally you are not a gentleman,
no sign and motto will make you one. Indeed,
some badges on harness only serve to make conspicuous
the fact that the horses are better bred
than the owners. This is a comparison that
should be avoided. It is not fair to the horses.</p>

<p>Lastly, in writing of harness, it is proper to
remind the horse owner that his harness like his
horse improves by use and proper care after use.
Therefore avoid having too much harness. Unless
you are a constant exhibitor in the show ring,
you can adapt your harnesses, if they are all
made in the same general pattern as to pads,
blinkers, terrets, brow-bands, and the like, to many
uses.</p>

<p>A runabout harness of heavy make, with part
of a double harness for your leader and a pair of
long reins and a pair of traces and terrets that
screw in and can be taken off, fit you out with a
tandem harness. One heavy and one light set
of double harness with similar arrangements as to
reins and terrets will fit you out with a four-in-hand
harness; and if you stick to about the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
type of horse, with your saddlers in the lead and
your harness horses in the wheel, you may have
all the varieties of driving without undue expense
and without an over-accumulation of harness.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pn center">THE AMERICAN HORSE</p>

<p class="pn p2">By far the most interesting type of horse to
the American is the American trotting-horse, not
only for the reason that he is of our own development,
but because in one way or another he does
duty for our harness horse, in practically every
capacity except as a draught animal. He is known
to horsemen the world over as the most docile and
most versatile of horses. He has been developed
and trained to go a mile in two minutes, and he
has been trained to step high, and to prove himself
to be in the highest class of harness horse, and he
is not bad under saddle. Indeed, more than one
blue-ribbon winner under the saddle from Virginia
and Kentucky is of this same stock. This docility
is shown in the wonderful performance of Belle
Hamlin, Justina, and Globe, driven a mile, three
abreast, in 2.14 by Ed. Geers.</p>

<p>In writing of the American trotting-horse one
is confronted at the outset with the question of
from what standpoint he is to be considered;
whether as race-horse, road-horse, heavy harness
horse, or general utility horse, as in all of these
capacities he is without an equal, and almost
without a competitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>The American trotting-horse is the result of
the development of a type produced from heterogeneous
breeds; and while several districts of the
country had their favorite strains of blood, there
was no system of breeding which promised sure
results until Hambletonian stamped his offspring
with speed, and the instinct to trot; which have
been developed by the breeding of horses with
speed already developed or with speed inheritance.
Trotters may now be bred, with a certainty
that the produce will at least excel in speed horses
of any other breed, and with a likelihood of great
speed.</p>

<p>The breeding of Hambletonian (Plate XXVII.),
who traces back to Messenger on side of both
sire and dam, has never been questioned.
Messenger was imported to Philadelphia from
England in 1788. He was a gray stallion by
Mambrino, first dam by Turf, second dam by
Regulus, third dam by Starling, fourth dam by
Fox, fifth dam Gipsey, by Bay Bolton, sixth dam
by Duke of Newcastle's Turk, seventh dam by
Byerly Turk, eighth dam by Taffolet Barb, ninth
dam by Place's White Turk. He was eight years
old when he came over.</p>

<p>The breeding of the dam of Hambletonian,
known as the Charles Kent mare, is only questioned
by those who, having failed in breeding
on other lines, have sought relief by attacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Hambletonian's breeding, conformation, disposition,
and individuality, without considering that
his record in the stud disproves any and every
contention of the kind. There is no success like
success. At any rate, all agree that the greatest
success in breeding trotters has been achieved by
a liberal use of Hambletonian blood; and a
winner with none of his blood is a curiosity.
From Dexter, with a record of 2.17½ in 1867 down
to Lou Dillon with a record of 1.58½ in 1903,
every champion trotter except one is known to
have carried Hambletonian's blood, and the exception
probably did. The 2.10 list of to-day
contains few without Hambletonian blood.</p>

<p>That Hambletonian impressed his progeny
with the trotting instinct, and that this remains
through generations, is shown by the history of
the Dexter branch of the family. Dexter's full
brother Dictator founded a family which increases
in number of winners yearly. This is also true of
his other offspring who were properly bred and
developed.</p>

<p>Whether Hambletonian inherited his ability to
impress his progeny with the trotting brain from
the Arab, the thoroughbred, the hackney, or
the native horse, is immaterial; that he had that
ability from some source, the stud book proves
beyond peradventure. Whatever combination
produced him it was a fortunate day for American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
horse-breeding when he was produced and placed
in Orange County, New York, where there were
many good mares for him and where soil and
water and climate all worked together for the good
of his offspring and enabled him to found perhaps
the best all-round type of horse in the world.</p>

<p>All of Hambletonian's get had the instinct to
trot, and by breeding to those also having this
instinct, which was of necessity in-breeding, it has
been increased until the trot is their natural gait,
and three-year-olds trot as fast as the champion
of thirty years ago. While it has taken nearly a
century to reduce the trotting record a minute,
and while this reduction has been helped by improved
tracks, sulkies, methods of training and
shoeing, no one will question that the percentage
of horses who can trot fast has increased to such
an extent that a horse to trot in 2.20 is easier to
find to-day than a three-minute horse thirty years
ago.</p>

<p>The breed of American trotting-horse is of
such recent origin, only five generations from
Hambletonian to Lou Dillon, that it is not to be
wondered at that the type is not exact, and that
there are instances of reversion to outcrosses
which produce individuals which subject the
breed to criticism from those who judge quickly
rather than calmly.</p>

<p>There is practically no question that intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
breeding to a type will produce that type. This
is proved by the phenomenal success of the
Messrs. Hamlin. When Mr. C. J. Hamlin entered
the breeding business, he stated that he proposed
to breed not only speed, but beauty; and for
years Village Farm was not only the home of the
champions, but its produce was the most uniform
and beautiful known. The great majority of the
Hamlin horses bear the imprint of that grand
horse Mambrino King, who for several years called
forth spontaneous cheers, and applause, at Madison
Square Garden, captivating the audience by
his distinguished gait and bearing.</p>

<p>In conformation, the trotter has two distinctive
differences from the runner, in that the trotter is
longer in the body, than he is high, and is higher
at the coupling, or rump, than at the withers.
These differences, no doubt, are to accommodate
the structure to the rotary gait rather than to the
series of jumps of the runner. The trotter is
steadily improving not only in speed, but in beauty,
and it is only a matter of shoeing and education to
make him step high for heavy harness use. Photographs
show that all trotters at speed, step high
at some point in their stride, and shoeing and
bitting will so change the stride that it develops
a more circular form, and the grit and instinct to
trot enables them to go fast, high, and far, as compared
to any other high stepper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>In every use, other than draught-horse work,
the trotter stands alone as a general utility
horse. The intelligence and nervous restraint
which makes the two-minute trotter a possibility
also makes him, when used as a carriage horse,
safer than any other, even when surrounded by
the many hideous objects and noises he must face
in the city streets of to-day. Prominent coaching
men say that no horse in the world can draw a
loaded coach at the same speed, and stand the
work so well, as the American trotting-bred horse.</p>

<p>The road-horse is a strictly American institution,
and the possession of a trotter is about the first
sign of prosperity of a successful American who
lives outside of our great cities, where he is not
influenced by the desire for show. The typical
road-horse should have substance so that he can
draw two men twelve miles an hour with pleasure
to them and comfort to himself. He should have
speed enough to acquit himself creditably in
friendly brushes. Together with these qualities
he should have looks and manners. No breed
of horse except the American trotter combines
the conformation, speed, and brain, to fulfil these
requirements.</p>

<p>The attached diagram and table, taken from
the <i>New York Herald</i> after Lou Dillon had
trotted in two minutes, shows clearly the progress
of the trotter in the last hundred years.</p>

<p class="pn center p1">LOU DILLON'S DESCENT FROM HAMBLETONIAN
IN THE MALE LINE</p>

<p class="pbq p1">Lou Dillon is fifth in descent from Hambletonian in the
male line. This pedigree is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn center">
LOU DILLON<br />
SIDNEY DILLON<br />
SIDNEY<br />
SANTA CLAUS<br />
STRATHMORE<br />
HAMBLETONIAN</p>

<p class="p1">As to the training and education of the trotter,
that is a science which would require a book in
and of itself. Of the training of the trotting-bred
road-horse, no two men probably pursue exactly
the same methods, and no two horses require
exactly the same treatment, hence no hard and
fast rules can be laid down for every man or for
every horse. Each man can only give the fruit
of his own practical experience, judiciously mixed
with the experience of others.</p>

<p>The first lesson cannot be given too soon.
The day the foal is born it should be handled, and
made to feel, even at that tender age, that man is
its friend and master. This should be repeated
every day for several weeks, or even longer, until
the foal is perfectly gentle and friendly toward
its attendant, allowing itself to be stroked and
patted, and each leg in turn to be lifted so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the hoof may be examined and attended to, a
small halter put on and taken off, and by degrees
the foal gradually accustomed to lead and stand to
halter. With a little patience and judgment, all
this can be accomplished by the time the foal
is a month old, simply through kindness and
coaxing.</p>

<p>Most breeders leave all this undone, letting the
foals run wild until they are weaned, when they
are roughly and partially broken by sheer force
and awkwardness combined. Sometimes this is
not done till they are yearlings, or even older.
The educating methods when they are young
give the best results. These first lessons are
never forgotten, and the foal is practically born
in an atmosphere of docility and obedience. He
gains confidence in his master or attendant, and
never really learns to fight back at the end of a
halter strap, and is much more willing to accept
passively what may follow later on.</p>

<p>Instead of being in a state of terrorized obedience
and fearful of being hurt every time he is
approached by man with a strap or a piece of
harness in his hands, he comes to look upon his
training as agreeable play.</p>

<p>Before the foal is weaned he should be tied up
by the halter rope to a small manger in the stall
with his dam, long enough to finish a small feed
of crushed oats, and this should be continued as
part of his daily routine. He will fret much less
after being weaned when this is done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">His first lessons to harness should be given
soon after being weaned, during the winter that
he becomes a yearling. A surcingle may be first
thrown over his back and loosely buckled at first,
then gradually tightened up. Being already used
to the halter, he will not object to a snug-fitting
bridle. A leather bit is preferable to any other
for a young colt. By degrees the rest of the
harness may be put on with little or no trouble.
If the colt is suspicious, let him see, smell, and
nose the harness before putting it on. The colt
should be led around with long reins, taught to
turn to either side, to stop at the word "whoa,"
and also to back. Then he may be hitched up to
a small cart, especially built, with long shafts, low
to the ground and running out behind the wheels,
so as to prevent rearing should this be attempted.
It is well, also, always to use a strong kicking-strap,
on the theory that "an ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure." With such a cart and
harness and lessons two or three times a week when
the weather is pleasant, wonderful progress will
often be made before it is time to turn the yearling
out to grass.</p>

<p>Next winter he is coming two years old, and
when taken up, the harness lessons should be resumed,
this time to regulation road-cart. At this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
stage a plain snaffle-bit should be used. An average
of twice a week in harness will be found sufficient,
although a short drive every pleasant day
may be indulged in. The colt should have the
run of a paddock for exercise. The bitting rig
may now be used to give the colt a good mouth, a
most essential thing, for there is no comfort in
driving a horse with a mean mouth. It is assumed
that all the driving is done with a light hand,
otherwise, instead of a road-horse, a rank puller is
being developed.</p>

<p>A young horse in harness can hardly be accustomed
at too early a stage to different sights and
sounds, provided they are introduced to him with
judgment and in a way not calculated to frighten
him. He should become acquainted with dogs,
cows, and such things as he is liable to meet on
the road. An umbrella open or shut should have
no terrors for him. In showing him an umbrella
and gradually opening it,&mdash;and putting it over
his head and all about him,&mdash;it is well to bear in
mind that a colt should be educated on both
sides. Whatever is done on the near side should
be repeated on the off side. Carts should be rattled
and pushed up against his haunches, and a hundred
and one things of the sort done,&mdash;all of which
will suggest themselves to a careful trainer. A
horse has little or no reasoning power. He has a
tenacious memory. What he has seen and knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
does not harm him, he is not afraid of. What he
has not seen he dreads, and being naturally the
most timid of all animals, he instinctively and
instantly thinks of flight, as his sole chance of
escape. Confidence in his driver will counteract
to a certain extent his dread and his thoughts of
flight. A horse that is whipped past an object he
is afraid of is being forced to choose the lesser of
two evils, and in proportion to the extent of his
fear must be the severity of the whipping to
induce him to pass the dreaded object. Some
horsemen pride themselves on their ability to
"make" a horse pass anything or go anywhere.
This method ruins a horse for pleasure driving,
for when he sees something which frightens him,
he knows he is between two fires. Ultimately, he
may be cowed into submission and pass things
without starting, but his spirit is broken, and he
is no longer a gentleman's road-horse.</p>

<p>The better plan is to gradually accustom a
horse to steam cars, trolley cars, automobiles,
steam rollers, etc., taking him a little nearer each
time, and encouraging him with voice and rein to
pass. Not every man will succeed in doing this.
Your true horseman, like your poet, is born and
not made. Before bringing his charge to this
point, he will have absolute control of his young
horse, and the horse has every confidence in his
driver. The driver is confident and fearless, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
knowing thoroughly the nature and limited capacity
of his pupil, so manages things that the confidence
and fearlessness are mutual, and so in time
the horse responds cheerfully and fearlessly to the
slightest wish of his driver. In the hands of a
timid, nervous man, the same horse is likely to
develop into a dangerous shyer, if not a puller or
a runaway.</p>

<p>Every harness-horse should be taught to back
and to stand. He should understand this before
being harnessed to a cart, and time and care cannot
be better employed than in making him proficient
in both backing and stopping at the word
of command, with every vehicle to which he may
be harnessed. A horse may do both every time
he is asked in a two-wheeled cart, and yet refuse
to do either and have to be taught all over again
when put to a four-wheeled vehicle.</p>

<p>Another valuable accomplishment is to walk
fast. A lazy driver will sometimes make a slow
walker of a naturally fast one, but this should not
be tolerated. Some colts are naturally inclined
to poke along at a snail's pace when walking, and
are most satisfactory in every other respect.
They will acquire the habit of brisk walking if
they are harnessed double with a fast-walking
horse. It is time well spent in teaching a horse
to acquire the habit.</p>

<p>In driving young horses to pole, they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
be driven different days on alternate sides,&mdash;first
on the near side, then on the off side, or <i>vice
versa</i>.</p>

<p>Open bridles should be used to begin with, and
afterwards the blind bridle may be substituted.
A driving-horse should be equally at home with
either kind. While a plain snaffle is preferable
for most horses, it will not always answer. In
that case, the only way is to experiment with different
bits until a suitable one is found. A
severe bit should never be used except as a last
resort.</p>

<p>The abuse of overdraw checks cannot be too
severely reprobated. Many a good horse has his
mouth and temper ruined, and his neck muscles
made rigid instead of remaining, as they should,
flexible and pliable, by the inordinate craze for
the "Kimball Jackson" check. Some horses
may, and probably do, require it; but, in my
opinion, they are few and far between. Many
road drivers seem to think such a check must be
used on a fast trotter. It is well to recall that
Jay-Eye-See, the first horse to trot a mile in 2.10,
was driven with a side-check; and Lou Dillon,
who has trotted a mile in 1.58½, and is the two-minute
marvel of the day, goes without any check
whatever. These two noted examples should
silence all arguments about the necessity for an
overdraw check in order to increase the speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The pleasure of a driving-horse depends as
much as anything else upon his stopping and
standing wherever and whenever you wish him to
do so. Young horses are often impatient of this
restraint, coming at irregular intervals and places,
and it is one of the hardest things to train a horse
to do. A good plan is to have them follow
behind a wagon, particularly if loaded with hay,
and have the wagon start and stop, and the colt
you are driving behind it do likewise. This
stopping and starting seems to him more natural,
coming as it does from the forcible argument of a
load of hay in front of him, rather than a pulling
on his mouth from behind.</p>

<p>Just as the American trotting-bred horse makes
the most agreeable harness-horse in the world, so
he is well worth all the time and patience required
to make him what he can become. A few months'
kindliness, firmness, and patience when his schooling
begins mean years of pleasure and safety to
his owner later on. Above all, get all idea out of
your head of "breaking" a horse. He is the last
animal in the world to be made companionable or
useful by being beaten and roughly handled and,
as the phrase is, "broken." In his bitting, harnessing,
and handling he should be made to do
things by patience rather than by force. The notion
that a horse should never be allowed to refuse
to do what is required of him, but that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
there and then be beaten into obedience is not
only a false notion, but results badly. Instead of
thrashing him past what he shies at, it is far
better in the end to keep at the problem day after
day until he learns through habit rather than by
the whalebone. It takes more time, but in the
end the results are far more satisfactory. It is in
these early days of the training of the road-horse
or harness-horse that the wise owner puts all he
knows of bitting, harnessing, shoeing, and feeding
into practice. It is at these times, too, that he
learns by scores of experiments which of the
many counsels he has read or listened to is the
wisest. It may be said, indeed, that an owner is
and remains partially ignorant and incompetent,
until he has watched and bitted and driven, day
after day, an equine problem of his own.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The success of every drive, whether with one
horse, two horses, four horses, or six horses,
depends upon three things: the comfort of your
horse, yourself, and your passengers.</p>

<p>Of the comfort of the horse much has been
said already, and all that has been said may well
be emphasized and even repeated. He should be
ready to go out, that is, not too soon after nor too
long after feeding. His bit and harness should
be comfortable and adequate to the work he is to
do. His shoes and feet should be in good condition.
If a horse is properly looked after by his
caretaker in the stable, casting a shoe should be
a rare occurrence. The horse being comfortable
at the start, everybody's comfort behind him
depends upon his being kept comfortable. He
should not be asked to go too fast or too slow, or
asked to do too much at one time, and his mouth
should be kept fresh.</p>

<p>As for the coachman, his harness, too, should fit
him. The writer has seen a rein dropped and a
horse in a four go sprawling on the pavement, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
on account of the ill-fitting hat of the coachman,
who was grabbing at his head-gear at an inopportune
moment. It is even a matter of consequence,
if you are to be the custodian of other people's
safety on a drive, that your hat should fit you well
enough to stay on, even in a fresh breeze.</p>

<p>Gloves should be of dogskin, and at least a
size too big. Your hand should be able to bend
as though there was no glove on it. If the glove
is not as big as this, or even bigger, your reins
will slip toward the middle of your fingers, where
they should not be, but held snug in toward the
roots of the fingers; and you cannot easily bend
your hand round to make a pivot of your wrist,
upon which the whole easy give-and-take between
the hand and the horse's mouth depends. In
our hot climate it makes for coolness in summer
to punch a few holes in the backs of the gloves,
and turn over the wrists on to the backs of the
hands. Driving gloves with only one seam up
and down the fingers are the most comfortable
(see plates).</p>

<p>A pair of woollen gloves should always be taken
in tandem or four-in-hand driving to use in case
of wet weather. Nobody can drive in tight-fitting
gloves. You may steer and pull, but drive, never.
Every single suggestion as to holding and fingering
the reins is negatived if tight gloves are worn.
It then becomes a physical impossibility to so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
manœuvre hands, wrists, and fingers that the
horse's mouth shall have a chance. Wet gloves
can be got in shape and flexibility again by the
use of Crown soap well rubbed into them while
they are wet. When they are dry again, they will
be as good as ever.</p>

<p>In the matter of the driver's cushion, it is well
to be above your horse, even in a runabout. This
gives better control, more power, and keeps the
reins off the horse's back, so that they may come
back directly from the pad-terrets to the hand.
The cushion should always, in whatever vehicle,
be of cloth, and tufted to avoid slipping. You
will have enough to do without using your legs
as props to hold you on your seat. So much
depends upon the physical proportions of the
coachman that it is impossible to give figures as
to the proper size and slant of cushion. Three
inches and a half is a fair slant of cushion. The
knees should be bent at a comfortable angle, and
the feet resting on the foot-board in such a way
that the ankles are not bent at an uncomfortable
angle. In driving two as a pair or tandem, or
four horses, this matter of a comfortable and
secure seat is important, and will repay considerable
attention.</p>

<p>If for any reason&mdash;as in the case of a dog-cart
balanced at different angles&mdash;the distance between
the seat and the foot-board is altered, or where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
a child or short-legged person needs a brace for
the feet, never under any circumstances have a
rail. A foot-board covered with corrugated rubber
made to fit in, and which can be taken out
when not needed, is all that is necessary. A rail
across the bottom of the foot-board, often seen in
the lighter style of vehicles, such as buggies, buckboards,
and the like, is an invention of the devil
and most dangerous. It is entirely unnecessary,
and it is easy to catch your toe or toes underneath
it, and the consequences may be horribly serious.
In one case a lady, catching a low shoe under such
a rail and struggling to get it out, was thrown
over the dash-board between her horses and
killed. Such a rail serves no real purpose and
has no possible defence except a very short-sighted
economy. If your light vehicle has such
a rail as a rest for the feet, either take it out or
put another rail across parallel to it so that it is
impossible to catch even the toes underneath it.</p>

<p>If a horse gets his tail over a rein, stop him
and lift his tail off the rein; do not jerk the rein
from under the tail. A clever whip, driving
tandem or four, can often, by a judicious turning
of the horse and a flick with the whip, make
the horse take his tail off the rein himself, but
this is for the <i>cognoscenti</i>; the beginner had
best take the safest and surest way out of trouble
and either let the groom or his passenger help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
him out. If alone, slow up, do no tugging and
jerking, loosen the rein, turn your horse quickly
and decidedly the other way, and flick him on the
quarters with the whip. If it were not that every
now and then some one is kicked in the head by
leaning over the dash-board to get hold of the
horse's tail, it would seem unnecessary to forbid
absolutely such a copper-fastened fool proceeding.</p>

<p>Of docked tails, bearing-reins, cruppers, and
the like, there are, season after season, endless discussions.
The cause of the discussion is usually
due not to a wise, but to a cruel, use of these, and is
generally carried on in a legislature where only
a small minority know anything of the horse
except as a quiet farm animal, seldom driven out
of a walk. As soon as the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals adds to its board
of directors half a dozen theoretically and practically
competent horsemen, there will be a change
for the better in these matters, both practically
and legislatively.</p>

<p>There are many competent horsemen who maintain,
and with reason, that the long tail is dangerous,
particularly where women and children drive;
that a tail over the rein may mean a mishap, and
probably injury; that it is dirty, bedraggles and
wets the legs, and with the fast-moving, well-cared-for
carriage horse is unnecessary, even to his comfort.
This does not, on the other hand, imply that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
horses' tails should be docked and "set up"; but
it does point to a happy medium between the
dangerous and dirty long tail and the unnecessarily
short dock. The question should not be
looked upon as having but one answer. Men
who have themselves docked horses and seen
scores of horses docked, and who take the most
instructed care of their horses, are naturally provoked
by criticism from citizens who hardly know
that a horse's tail has joints in it, let alone anything
about the feeding, housing, or handling even
of their own horses.</p>

<p>So very few people know how much there is to
know about the horse, that their ignorance neither
oppresses, nor suppresses them.</p>

<p>As for the bearing-rein, here again the question
is one of use. For the misuse of the bearing-rein
there is no defence. The bearing-rein prevents
shaking about of the head, rubbing off of the
bridle, catching the bit or bridle, getting the head
down between the legs, obstinate boring; and,
driving in town, it is a valuable piece of auxiliary
harness. Its misuse, to hold a horse's head in an
unnatural position and to make him lift his feet,
is not only cruel, but vulgar&mdash;vulgar being used
to express the type of mind that measures everything
by appearances.</p>

<p>The crupper keeps the saddle in place, helps
materially to prevent the horse from getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
his tail over the rein, and disinclines him to
kick.</p>

<p>The breeching is, or ought to be, considered
indispensable in a hilly country, even with light
vehicles, and is a proper precaution in all cases
where women or children act as coachman.</p>

<p>Brakes are a French invention, and might be
supposed to come under much the same strictures
as the breeching. But while a breeching is useful
and never out of place, except perhaps on the
leaders where horses are driven in front of each
other, the brake is so often misused, with consequent
damage to the horse, the harness, the vehicle,
and the skill of the driver, that it almost
deserves a chapter by itself. In the old days of
heavy coach-loads, the wheelers, helped by the
skilful coachman, took the coach down hill. But
a mistake, or a break in the harness or the pole,
meant disaster. The brake, which cramps the
wheels and takes some of the strain of holding
back off the horses, was a valuable invention.</p>

<p>A limited amount of alcohol given at the right
time is an indispensable medicine and a boon to
the race. Alcohol taken at all times and generally
by the wrong persons, in the wrong places, is the
curse of the Anglo-Saxon race. England, with
one in forty of its population classed as incompetent,
is the story of the misuse of alcohol.</p>

<p>The brake shoved on violently at every declivity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
racks the vehicles, burdens the horse by not
allowing him to go part of his road without the
weight of the vehicle behind him, puts unnecessary
strain on the harness at the wrong time, and
tends to make the coachman careless. The brake
shoved on with a jerk at every stop jars everybody
in the vehicle, and has been known, not
once, but often, to actually chuck people clean
out of the vehicle, both behind and in front, besides
bringing the horse into his collar with a
painful galling of his shoulders. On a level place
the brake should never be used to stop the vehicle.
After the vehicle has been stopped, particularly if
it be a heavy one, the brake may be put on and
left on until the next start is made&mdash;this as a
measure of precaution.</p>

<p>Never put on the brake in any case with the
whip in the right hand. Transfer your whip to
the left hand and avoid the danger of flicking
the horse in front of you by dropping it toward
him; or of flicking the passengers behind you by
dropping it toward them; and above all avoid the
danger of breaking or losing your whip altogether.
When the brake is to be put on, you need your
whole hand to do it. Put on and take off the
brake quietly. Knowing horses will often start
off at the sound of the brake. The brake should
not be regarded as a regular part of the harness.
It is good for a horse to do some holding-back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
work, and a bad habit to get him to the point
where he shirks this part of the work, or refuses
to do it at all. Then in case the brake does not
work, or you are without one, the refusal may
cause trouble. The brake is only for use when
there is too much strain on horse and harness&mdash;not
for use every time we go down the smallest
declivity. Such use of it spoils rather than helps
the horse. It is torture to a passenger to see and
feel the brake go on, before the descent is reached
even, and then kept on yards after there is no
need of it. As a matter of fact, good men and
good horses are able to negotiate any ordinary
road, without any brake at all; it is a precautionary
measure and a convenience. But for all driving
in hilly country by the average coachman it
should not be omitted, nor should it be misused.
Where other people share the danger, it
is always best to err on the safe side. Do not
start down any hill fast. With a heavy load, and
horses well in hand, you may put on steam toward
the bottom and give the cattle a little relief. In
going up a hill, do not become impatient and
urge horses into a faster pace before you reach the
brow of the hill. It is hard on a horse to pull up
a hill, and then to be forced into a trot just before
reaching the top, where the strain is hardest. Once
on the level, give a little breathing-space and then
start along. Remember always, whether going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
down hill, or approaching a troublesome crowd of
vehicles, or with a corner to turn ahead of you,
that the time to slow up is before you get there.
You should slow up with your eyes, and stop with
your hands. That is to say, you should begin
operations as soon as your eyes discover trouble
ahead, and not leave it to the last moment; and
then, with your hands in the air, your back at an
angle of 45°, your horses on their haunches, and
the carriage on top of them, just save yourself.
It is much easier to avoid trouble than to get out
of it. If you are alone, and with no one dependent
upon you for support, your neck is your own;
but with passengers, for whose safety you have
tacitly pledged yourself, the moment you take
the reins you have no right to take the smallest
risk, and besides you are in honor bound to use
your very best efforts for their safety and comfort.
Above all things do not fancy that you are
a coachman, because you own horses and can
drive them. Bad driving in New York is responsible
for one death a day the year round.</p>

<p>The hands should be carried under average circumstances
at about the level of the watch chain
when worn in the lower waistcoat pocket; the
arm horizontal from the elbow, which position
puts the hands slightly lower than the elbow.
But this direction should not for a moment be
taken as a hard and fast rule. You will see first-rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
coachmen, some with the hand higher, some
with the hand lower than this. The reasons for
the differences are simple. With a nicely bitted
team in a show ring or in the Park, where a
touch is enough, the left hand if raised a little can
be turned more easily, the points can be made by
the right hand with less movement, and there is
no danger of tiring either hand or arm. On the
other hand, the coachman who has a fifty-mile
drive before him, with many different horses to
handle, will place his hand lower, with more comfort
to himself, and with less risk of numbing his
hand and arm.</p>

<p>Driving with the hands held up under the chin,
or out in front of one, as though presenting a
visiting-card on a tray, are merely the monkey
mannerisms of the ignorant. This is often the
result of having seen others drive without understanding
the reasons for their position of the
hands. Those most accomplished coachmen,
Howlett, father and son, in teaching hold the
hands higher than the ordinary for the very
sufficient reason that they can handle a team
admirably, this way or any other way, and because
it is much easier to show the pupil what is going
on with the reins and fingers in that position.
But when young Howlett so easily distanced his
competitors, and won the five-hundred-dollar
prize at the Madison Square Garden, he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
handle the reins in an exaggerated or conspicuous
fashion. Holding the hands too high is conspicuously
awkward, besides showing the performer
to be ignorant of his business and making
it exceedingly difficult to pull up quietly and
quickly. It may be set down as an axiom, that
the coachman who looks self-conscious and in a
strained position is doing something he does not
understand, because he guesses it is right. A
snob may be borne with on dry land; but on the
cushion he is dangerous. The institutional bore
who illustrates the evident, explains the obvious,
and expatiates on the commonplace is merely an
irritant at dinner; but at the helm of a boat or
behind horses his slovenly omniscience presages,
or prepares for, disaster.</p>

<p>But more than any other one thing, inattention
is the cause of most accidents. Something goes
wrong because the coachman, through inattention,
was unprepared for it, and then things happen
that cannot be avoided. Nine runaways out of
ten begin with carelessness; once started there is
no help this side of a smash-up. You may see
not once, but ten times, a day the owner of a
vehicle put down his reins, get out, and instead of
going to the horse's head, until the groom can
get to the reins, walk off. The writer has seen
two expensive smash-ups due to the fact that a
high-strung horse, startled by a noise or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
unexpected sight, broke away while the groom was
getting from the horse's head to the seat. A
horse finding himself entirely and unexpectedly
at liberty, loses his head more often than not, and
then does any mad thing, from kicking to running
away, that comes easiest.</p>

<p>The harness-horse, it is to be remembered, is
always under control, and just to feel no restraining
hand is in and of itself enough to upset him.
Very few horses if restrained in time can get
away with a fairly strong man, but no man living
can stop two, or even one, much less four horses,
once they get the jump on him and a good galloping
start. The important thing is to keep such
watch and ward that the horse gets no chance to
get even one jump before he is pulled up, and that
means ceaseless vigilance. If you have had accidents,&mdash;and
if you have ridden or driven much, you
have had accidents,&mdash;you will recall that the cause
was unexpected, and things happened just at that
particular fraction of a second when you were off
your guard. In teaching any one to drive, particularly
children, this point cannot be too much
emphasized. The eyes, so to speak, should be in
the boat, or in equine parlance on the horse, the
whole livelong time,&mdash;from the moment you take
up the reins till some one has the horse's head at
the end of the journey. Lacking this fundamental
axiom of all driving, everything else goes for
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>The whip should be used smartly and for a
purpose, or not at all. It is best to hit your
horse forward of his pad or saddle, except where
in tandem or four-in-hand driving the leaders
should be hit on the hind legs, under, not above,
the trace. Never, in any kind of driving, use your
whip with the rein in the same hand as the whip.
To hit a horse with the whip, and to jab him in
the mouth at the same time, renders both signals
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The reins should never be flopped about on
the horse's back in lieu of the whip. This jabs
the mouth, confuses the horse, and puts him not
only to confusion, but out of your direct control.
The connection between hand and bit should
never be cut off while the horse is in motion,
any more than you should unship your rudder
while sailing a boat. Do not turn corners too
fast nor too soon. When the hub of your front
wheel is opposite the corner you are to turn, even
if you be too close on that side, there is little
danger of hitting even with the hind wheel.
Above all things, look where you are going and
watch your horse! In any sport where the pleasure
and safety of others are in your keeping, to
show off or to take risks is unpardonable and
dangerous folly.</p>

<p>"Form," of which we hear so much in relation
to driving, is here as everywhere else either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
rational or ridiculous. Form is rational when it
is the proper clothing of an idea; form is ridiculous
when it is merely an idea of proper clothing.
When you dress comfortably, and sit securely, and
hold the reins firmly and lightly, you drive in
good form because you are obeying the well-thought-out
laws of the sport. When you merely
copy the externals without knowing why, you are
ridiculous. This is the whole secret of form.
One is matter, the other is merely manner. One
is rational, the other ridiculous.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pn center">DRIVING ONE HORSE</p>

<p class="pn p2">Once you have a horse and know something
of his make-up inside and out, and have housed
him properly, and bought his harness and learned
something of its use, the next thing is to make
the connection, first between the horse and the
vehicle, and then between yourself and the horse.</p>

<p>The carriage should be run out first, the pole
or shafts put in place and dusted, the proper whip
and robes got together. It may be well for the
owner to realize that a man alone should have at
least three-quarters of an hour to turn out on the
box of a brougham or Victoria, proportionally
less time for a runabout or other light carriage,
on which he is to appear in stable clothes. The
horse should be brought out of or turned in his
stall and attached to the pillar-reins, and his feet,
coat, and head gone over. The collar should then
be stretched and put over his head, being careful
not to rub hard against the eye-bones in so doing,
fasten on the hames, and turn the collar into
place. It is easier to fasten hames on to the
collar before the collar is turned. Then put on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the bridle, seeing to it that the bit is in its proper
place, as well as the winkers, and that both sides
of the bridle are of the same length. The saddle
should be placed first well back on the horse, so
that the crupper may be put under the tail without
undue pulling and hauling. Then place the
saddle where it belongs on the horse's back, and
tighten up the girth. Run the reins through
their terrets and fasten them to the bit, and
lead your horse out and back him into the shafts.
Never take hold of the bit in leading him out
but by the nose-band. If you slip or stumble or
he throws his head, if you have him by the bit
you jab him in the mouth, and then even before
he is in the vehicle he is sensitive and restive.
Put your horse as near the carriage as possible
without danger of hitting when in motion. The
tug girth, which holds the shafts, should be
tight enough to hold the shafts in place in a
four-wheeled carriage, but loose enough to allow
a certain amount of play in two-wheeled carriages.
Where, as in a gig harness, the play is given by
the tug itself, this is not necessary.</p>

<p>In unharnessing, take off the bearing-rein, unfasten
the traces, then the tug girth&mdash;not <i>vice
versa</i>, so that if a horse starts forward there will be
something to prevent the carriage running on his
heels. Always loosen a curb-chain before taking
off a bridle,&mdash;this applies equally to the horse in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
harness or under saddle,&mdash;and lastly the breeching.
The reins should be unbuckled from the bit,
drawn back through the terrets, and hung over the
arm or out of the way. Take off the pad, turn
the collar, and take off the hames, then turn the
collar back and leave it in its place a few minutes
to prevent galled shoulders. The bit and curb-chain
should be thrown into the bucket of lime
water, or at any rate cleaned carefully at once.
It is much easier to prevent rust than to get
it off.</p>

<p>In taking out a pair, the reins should be unbuckled
first of all and pulled through from the
front. If you drive into the stable, do it yourself
before dismounting. In taking off the traces,
begin with the inside one, then the outside one,
then the pole-chains or pole-pieces. Take off the
saddles, turn the collars, remove the hames, leaving
collars on as before. It is a great saving of
time, and lessens confusion, to fix the habit of
both harnessing and unharnessing in a regular
way, until it becomes mechanical; and mistakes
are not made, and accidents do not happen, because
the habit of doing things properly has
become fixed. Have your buckle-rein on off-side
horse. First, because that marks the rein,
and, secondly, because as that rein is the one not
thrown across there is less likelihood of hitting
and hurting the attendant on that side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Before you take the reins in your hand look
over the trap, harness, and horse, and see that all
is right. The stop on the shafts should by all
means be behind the tugs; the traces, collar,
breeching, bridle, girths, bit, bearing-rein, should
be looked over, first, to see if you may drive in
safety, and then to confirm you in what you have
learned about these things.</p>

<p>Take the reins in the left hand, the near rein
over the second finger, the off rein between the
third and fourth finger. No matter what the
vehicle is, take the whip with you when you get
into it. The whip in the socket is in the way,
and the whip should be almost as constantly in the
hands as the reins anyway, so that it is better to
begin with the whip where it belongs. Then place
the reins in the right hand with the whip, mount
to your place, take your seat quickly, change the
reins back into the left hand, see that they are
about the right length <i>without</i> feeling your horse's
mouth, which would make him start before you
are ready, and you are ready to send your first
telegram to your horse. Do it discreetly, gently,
and if you are not where your voice will disturb
other horses, add a word of some kind, preferably
a signal not in common use between men
and horses. A horse learns quickly to recognize,
and does not forget, his owner's voice. That voice
encourages, soothes, or commands him. But where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
you are driving with or surrounded by others, the
use of your voice in the well-known click or chirrup
would disturb all the horses and coachmen
about you. It is easy to accustom your own
horses to any phrase: "Come on now," "Look
alive," or even "What's the matter?" which conveys
no message to other horses and at the same
time rouses your own. The writer has an intimate
acquaintance with several horses who will
start into action at hearing "Come on now," in
a well-known voice.</p>

<p>Nothing is more disagreeable at a railway
station, in a hurly-burly of traps and horses,
than the clicking and clucking and snapping
of whips, which, while meant for one or two
horses, disturb half a dozen. Two-thirds of the
coachmen on private carriages catch sight of
their masters, flap the horses with the reins, swing
the whip, and chirrup; and yet they would be surprised
to be told that they do not know the rudiments
of driving. Nothing smacks more of the
farmer than a man who, behind you, or passing
you, or standing near you and wishing to start,
clicks or clucks to his horse, starting your horse
up at the same time. A man who cannot start
one, two, or four horses with his hands, and
without a hullabaloo of noise, is unworthy to
sit behind horses at all. If your horses are new
to your stable, or awkward and untrained, feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the mouth gently, and if this is not understood
or is misunderstood, use the whip gently and
make your start in that way. The perfection
of starting is to have the horse feel his bit on
his bars almost exactly at the moment his shoulders
feel the collar&mdash;a fraction of a lightning
stroke after, to be exact.</p>

<p>When you are ready to start either out of the
stable or from the door, have the man stand clear.
No leading of the horse forward, no pulling at
bit or nose-band; give the horse a chance to
learn what you want of him without puzzling
him with a variety of signals.</p>

<p>It is a little ahead of time to speak of it here,
but, lest we forget, it may be mentioned at once.
Never allow the groom or grooms to stop your
horse or horses, whether one, two, or four, when
you drive into the stable. This makes horses
restless, makes them back, slide, or kick, and in
the case of a four may result in a general mix-up.
Stop your horses gradually, with voice and
reins, but stop them yourself. They have come
in from the drive more or less accustomed to
your hands and ways, according as you are more
or less proficient, and a rough hand on bit or nose,
and an apparition in front of them, ought to,
and generally does, upset them. Besides all this
you ought to, and they ought to know how
to stop properly, and without fuss or flurry exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
when and where you wish them to, even if
it be on the cement floor of your stable entrance.</p>

<p>The reins should be held with the near rein
between the thumb and first finger, the off
rein between the third and fourth fingers. Hold
your hand so that your knuckles, turned toward
your horse, and the buttons on your waistcoat,
will make two parallel lines up and down with
the hand three or four inches from the body.
The reins should be clasped, or held by the two
lower, or fourth and fifth fingers; the second
finger should point straight across and upward
enough to keep the near rein over the knuckle
of that finger and the thumb pointing in the
same direction, but not so much upward. The
reins are held, not by squeezing them on their
flat surface, but by pressure on their <i>edges</i>. The
edges, in a word, being held between the two
last fingers and the root of the thumb. This
arrangement makes a flexible joint, the wrist, for
the reins and for the bit to play upon. This
suppleness of the wrist, just enough and not too
much, is what is called "hands." It means, that
your wrist gives just enough play to the horse's
mouth to enable him to feel your influence, without
being either confused or hampered by it.</p>

<p>As this is the key to perfection in all driving,
everybody claims to possess it; only the elect few
have it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>Practically everybody can learn to play the
piano or the violin, or to write tolerable verses;
only a very few, indeed, ever attain to supreme
command over these instruments, or over the
music of words. Training and teaching may
accomplish much and make fair or even excellent
performers; but beyond that it is divine grace,
born not made, given not attained. The same is
true of driving: you may be one of the elect, but
if you are, you belong to a society as small as
that of the Knights of the Garter, and you need
not be vain, since it was no hard work of yours,
but an endowment. It is a combination of physical
and mental traits, a quickness of connection
between nerve and brain and muscle, that may
be cultivated and improved in all men, but which
reaches perfection only in the few. Corbett, in
"An Old Coachman's Chatter," says, "Even for
a good amateur to acquire professional style requires
two years averaging eighty miles a day,
with a fair amount of night work."</p>

<p>A persistent man may do much. He may learn
to write excellent verse, with no hope of ever being
a poet; he may learn to jump higher than the average,
without the slightest prospect of doing six
feet, six and a half inches, which thus far has only
been done by one man in the world; he may learn
to run, or swim, or speak, but the heights of the
unexcelled are not for him. This much ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
said about driving at the start. You may read books
from now till doomsday, and you may practise, and
you will undoubtedly become an excellent and
trustworthy coachman, far above the average,&mdash;not
a difficult attainment, by the way,&mdash;but to
have this magic of "hands" is not, I believe, attainable
except to those endowed physically and
mentally with peculiar powers, in peculiar combination.
It is because everybody thinks he
knows how to drive, simply because he can steer
quadrupeds with steel in their mouths, that this
point is emphasized. No one need neglect this
sport on the ground that the vision and the attainment
are limited; they are not, and to most men
even confident competence is denied, not to speak
of this virtuosity of hands.</p>

<p>Now that you are in your seat with the reins
as they should be, between the thumb and second
and between the third and fourth fingers of your
left hand, wrist properly bent, and in a sufficiently
humble and docile state of mind, you should notice
why the reins are separated by two fingers
instead of one, and why the near rein is kept so
far as possible over the knuckle of the second
finger. Just as the wrist makes play backward
and forward, so this separation of the reins enables
you to make play sideways or across the horse's
mouth. By turning your hand toward you, so
that the knuckles, instead of facing the horse, face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the sky, you shorten that upper rein, the near
rein, and your horse goes over to the left, or near
side. By turning your hand just the other way
and bringing it across to the left hip, you shorten
the off rein and turn your horse to the right.
All done with one hand, you still have the other
for your whip, to render any assistance needed.
There are scores of times when to steer your
horse, and still to have the right hand free, means
not merely convenience, but safety.</p>

<p>It is a peculiarity of driving that it is almost
the one sport in which the sportsman is the
custodian of, and responsible for, other people.
A man rides, shoots, and does other dangerous
things alone, but nine times out of ten he drives
with others alongside of him. It is doubly necessary,
therefore, that he should know his business
thoroughly, and, if he is to make a practice of
driving others, that he should spare no pains to
know all that he can.</p>

<p>The fact that the left hand is held as directed
keeps the reins secure, and keeps them secure
with the least possible exertion. As this position
of the hand, wrist, and fingers is a little awkward
at first to the beginner, most driving is done with
the wrist not held across the body, but pointing
toward the horse, with the thumb held over the
reins as a sort of clip and pointing also toward
the horse. The reins held in this fashion are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
necessity insecure and forever slipping forward,
and there is no leverage of wrist for the horse's
mouth, but a straight pull from an outstretched
arm.</p>

<p>One often hears the comment that one cannot
as easily hold a horse this way as with the reins,
say in both hands. That is exactly the secret of
it. It is just so that you cannot keep a dead pull
on the poor brute's mouth that this position is the
ideal one. You don't want to pull your horse,
but to drive him. Most driving, by the way, seems
to have as its central feature how to stop him,
rather than how to make him go pleasantly;
how to get the quickest and sharpest jerk on his
mouth in case of trouble, rather than how to exert
the least possible pressure that will command
obedience. With a well-bitted horse, you should
be able to make figure eights by moving the left
hand as directed without touching the reins with
the right hand at all. The position of the hired
coachman on the box of a Victoria or brougham
these days is a ludicrous one for the reason that
most of them, and evidently their masters, know
nothing of the reason for that position. It was
intended by balancing the coachman thus to prevent
his putting great weight on the reins, as he
might do if his feet and legs stuck out in front of
him and his hands were held at arm's length.
It is well and proper that he should be balanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
on his seat with his back hollowed in, his elbows
at his side, his hand across and in front of him;
but tucking his legs and feet back and way underneath
him defeats the whole plan by forcing him
to hold on by the reins, which is just what it was
hoped to avoid. His feet and legs, as in the case
of the gentleman coachman, should be at such an
angle in front of him that he has a perfectly easy
balance and something to brace against in case
he needs to exert extra power. On a lady's light
Victoria, with nothing but the narrow foot-board
in front of him, a coachman in this new-fangled
position is not only a figure of fun, but he is also
in grave danger of accident. This monkey-on-a-stick
attitude is a blundering misinterpretation of
a perfectly sensible rule.</p>

<p>So far as the amateur coachman is concerned,
he should sit straight, with his back so hollowed
that he can balance easily on his hips, not on the
edge of, but on the cushion, with his feet and legs
at a comfortable angle, and without that look of
going out after the reins one so often sees&mdash;a
care-worn, bent-over position, as though the reins
were sliding away, never to reappear.</p>

<p>Start out moderately, keep your horse at an
even pace, and come in toward the end of your
journey again at a moderate pace. A horse is
not saved by doing ten miles in two hours instead
of one. On the contrary, it takes less out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
a horse to make him do his journey at a smart
gait rather than to dawdle. You may have
noticed yourself that a brisk two hours' walk
takes far less out of you than the standing
around, the stopping and starting, and the general
dawdling of two hours' shopping. Here
again the size of the horse's stomach should help
to solve the problem of how fast and how far. It
is better that he should do his task at a brisk
pace and get back to his rub down, his meal, and
his rest, than that he should be jogged for a long
time at a stretch. Even when it is necessary to
keep him going and to keep him away from his
stable for an undue number of hours, which must
sometimes happen, he should be given a short
rest and a small meal of soft food; this will make
all the difference between over fatigue that may
result seriously, and fatigue easily cured by proper
rest. A horse worked at regular hours, and regularly
and properly fed, is three-quarters of the
way toward being and keeping in good condition.</p>

<p>Just as he should be started quietly, so he
should be stopped quietly. It is not the mark
of good driving to bring your one horse, or your
team, up to the stopping-place at a quick pace,
and then to pull up with a jerk&mdash;the horse's head
in the air, his mouth open because he has been
jabbed by the bit, the shafts pointing up, the
breeching tight, and the horse almost on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
haunches. This kind of stopping takes more
out of a horse than a mile of hard work. Begin
to stop some time before you stop. Shorten your
reins, decrease your pace, and whether it is driving
in the traffic of the street or at your own
door, slow up gradually. You can tell with certainty
whether a man knows his business by the
way he starts and stops. If you have stopped
as you should, the horse is not sitting in the
breeching, with his collar sliding toward the top
of his head; but horse and vehicle are stopped,
and yet the horse and the vehicle and harness
are all in position to go on again without a jerk.
This is of the utmost importance in driving in
the city streets, where you may find yourself in
serious trouble if, through inattention, you have
driven well into trouble, before planning to stop.
Your horse's nose, or your pole, has poked into
another horse or vehicle, or you are obliged to
pull up so suddenly that you throw your horse, or
horses down.</p>

<p>In America, where we turn to the right, pull
well over to your own side and slow down before
you get to the street corner around which you
wish to go, whether to the right or left. Leave
ample room for another vehicle to pass, even
though you should meet just at the turn. Many
horses, awkwardly enough, get their legs crossed
when turning, and on slippery pavements, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the pull up and the pull round come at the same
time, a horse is very apt to stumble, and even to
fall. Because you have turned many corners without
accident is no reason for not taking pains.
Many young coachmen escape perils through
sheer ignorance, but persistence in error and inattention
bring their punishment sooner or later,
and the horse skins his knees, or slides under the
shafts in a crowd, or kicks and hammers harness
and trap to bits. It is too late then to remember
to keep an eye out for what is going on ahead of
you, to turn corners carefully, and to slacken speed
gradually, and not all at once.</p>

<p>It is a safe rule in turning a corner to turn
only when the hub of your front wheel has
reached the line that the curb would make if
prolonged, then there is no danger of running on
to or against the corner itself. Even when turning
a corner to the right, and you are close to the
curb, this rule, if obeyed, will keep both front and
back wheels clear. If this is not done, the back
wheel, and sometimes both, go rubbing around
the curbstone, which, aside from the slovenliness
of the performance, is damaging to the wheel,
and racking to every bolt in the carriage. If in
the country, where often a large stone marks the
angle of the turn, to hit this stone or to go over
it is often to go over altogether.</p>

<p>The safest and quickest way to shorten the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
reins, when it must be done in a pinch, is to pull
them through from behind. If there are two
reins, grasp them between the thumb and second
finger of the right hand, open the fingers of the
left hand enough to let them run through, shorten
them to the required length, and take your grip
on them again, with the fingers of the left hand.
Every man finds, now and then, either through
the foolish driving of some one else, or through
unavoidable accident, that he must shorten his
reins quickly, and without risk of dropping one.
Under those circumstances the best way is to pull
them through from behind, though such exigencies
occur but seldom with a careful driver. Under
ordinary circumstances the best and gentlest way
is to place the right hand on the reins, in front of
the left, with thumb and finger over near rein and
last three fingers over off rein, and slide the left
up the reins the required distance. Here again
it is the mark of the careful driver that he never
seems to be obliged to do things in a hurry.
When it is necessary to stop, he has already
shortened up his reins, and is ready to stop.
When it is necessary to turn a corner, he has
already advised his horse by giving him the
office, and the corner is negotiated with scarcely
the movement of the hands. When it is time to
start, the horse seems to have been informed via
the reins and bit, and off he goes without a jerk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
In passing other vehicles from behind, pass to
their left. Do not pass at all unless you are
going at a quicker pace, and propose to maintain
it. To turn short across another man's horse,
and then go on at the same pace he is going, is
the veriest and vulgarest rudeness. The only
excuse for passing is that you are making faster
time than he is, and that you propose to keep
it up.</p>

<p>Drive with one hand. In the show ring, where
horses must show pace in a small ring, use the
right hand on the off rein. It gives better control,
and keeps the horse steadier. Keep the right
hand cautiously near, that you may use it to shorten
the reins, to steady the horse, or to add force
when the left hand is not sufficient. Carry your
whip pointing upwards, and slightly to the left,
say toward the left ear of your horse, in driving
one. Start slowly, drive at the same pace, once
you are started; it saves the horse, and is far more
agreeable to the passengers. Pull up gradually.
Turn corners slowly, and do not start to turn
too soon. Be continuously careful to keep your
horse's mouth fresh, by giving and taking between
your hand and his mouth, with just enough pressure
to keep him informed that you are behind
him, and no more. If you hang on to his mouth,
be sure that he will end by pulling your arms out.
If you use the whip on him, do not tap him continually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
or flick him, here and there, from time to
time, out of sheer idleness and inconsequence;
but if you use it, do it so that the horse knows it
is punishment and not play; otherwise you waste
the benefit to be derived from the whip, by accustoming
the horse to think that in your use of the
whip you are merely playing with him. Above
all, keep a good lookout ahead, and if you have a
horse that is worth driving at all, you may be
sure that it is also worth your while to keep an
eye on him all the time.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pn center">DRIVING A PAIR</p>

<p class="pn p2">So much depends upon the comfort of the horse
in his harness that it is well worth the owner's
time and attention to learn how the harness
should be put on, how the horses should be put to,
and then to see that both are done properly.</p>

<p>The collar goes on first, and where horses are
worked hard, and regularly, as in a road coach or
on a driving tour, it is well to put the collars on,
and leave them on a few moments before the rest
of the harnessing is done. The collar thus gets
warm against the neck, and there is that much
less danger of rubbing and chafing the skin, and
making a bad start. The usual custom is to put
the collar on with the hames attached. It is
better to fasten the hames about the collar after
the collar is on the horse, thus avoiding the
tendency to squeeze the collar on over his head.
After the saddle is on, the crupper under the tail,
and the saddle-girth loosely buckled to keep the
saddle in place, then is the time to tighten up the
hames. The traces are crossed over the back of
each horse with the outside trace on top. The bridle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
is then put on, and the reins drawn through the
pad-terrets, and the outside or draught rein buckled
to the bit, the inside or coupling rein fastened to
the nose-band underneath by passing the billet
through the loop, but without buckling it. Then
take the rein, double it, pass the bight of it
through the terret, with the loop over the bearing-rein
hook.</p>

<p>The horses are now ready to be led out by the
nose-band, not by the bit, and put to. Bring the
horses up from behind alongside the pole, rather
than toward the pole, when they must be turned,
and pushed up to the pole. Once there, fasten
them to the pole, and buckle the pole-strap at the
end hole, the near horse first, then the off horse.
Next fasten the traces, the outside one always
first. This seems awkward, and like doing things
upside down. The reason for it, however, is all-sufficient.
If the inside trace is put on first, the
horse may, often does, in fact, edge out from the
pole at the touch of something on the pole side
of him, and there is a struggle to get him back
so that the outside trace may be put on. This
may upset the other horse, and trouble follows.</p>

<p>Here, and at all other times, remember that in
dealing with horses, under every and all conditions,
a stitch in time saves at least eighteen.
Therefore put the outside trace on first, then the
inside trace, then proceed to pole up your horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
that is to say, put your pole-pieces through the
kidney-link from the inside out, and tighten them
up to what you consider the proper length.
This adjustment is a very nice one, and can only
be done accurately by one who, when driving,
notes carefully the effect upon pole, pole-pieces,
and collars, of a hole more or less. The horses
should not carry the pole, through being poled
too tight; neither should the pole go bobbing
about, through being poled too loose. Over
rough roads, horses should be poled up rather
loosely, to give play to the pole; otherwise, every
jar will swing and bump the whole vehicle. In
park driving, or driving over smooth roads, they
may be poled up more closely.</p>

<p>The more compact are horses, vehicle, and
coachman acting together as one, the more easily
and smoothly everything goes; but this is not to
be interpreted as approval of poling up horses so
tight that they are carrying the pole, and are
cramped and impeded. Pole-pieces of leather, or
chains, are a matter of custom. No vehicle has
chains where the coachman drives; while a mail-phaeton,
or lady's phaeton, where the master or
mistress drives, usually has chains rather than
leather. An authority to be depended upon
always in such matters, writes: "Pole chains
should be used only on a carriage driven by the
master or mistress, such as a coach, mail-phaeton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
or lady's phaeton; never on a carriage driven by
a coachman, such as a landau, coupé, or Victoria,
when straps should be used. This is a custom
based upon the fact that the working originals
of coaches and mail-phaetons had chains; an
adherence to it marks the difference between
well turned out and badly turned out vehicles."
Both breastplates and pole-pieces should go, the
former round both collar and hames, and the latter
round the collar and through the kidney-link
ring and not through the ring alone; otherwise
the small strap at the top of the collar holding
the hames together is the only safeguard, and
should this break, away goes your pole, and
probably your horses. But this precaution is only
necessary in heavy work. The breastplate holds
even if the hame-strap breaks, and to put the
pole-straps around the collar chafes the horse's
neck.</p>

<p>After the horses are poled up and their traces
fastened, the coupling-reins are fastened to the
bits. Certain writers on the subject advise buckling
the coupling-reins first of all. The writer
has no criticism to pass upon this, except that
experience shows that fastening two horses together
by the head, and then going to their heels
for the traces, often works badly. As long as
they are fastened together by their collars to the
pole it is not a matter of much moment anyway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
It is a matter for one's own judgment and experience
rather than of fixed law. All the other
matters of precedence and procedure in harnessing
have a rational sanction which makes them
imperative.</p>

<p>The reins are buckled together on the off side
and, as in the case of each single rein, the bight
of them passed through the off pad-terret of the
off horse and looped over the bearing-rein hook.
Your pair is now ready for your inspection; this
done, and as you are about to take the reins, the
bearing-reins are put on their hooks. In the case
of green or nervous horses it is well to start
them off first, fastening the bearing-reins as they
move off, and thus avoid jibbing, backing, and
even rearing in the stable. Take the reins in the
right hand with the middle finger between them,
see that the buckles of both reins are the same
length from your hand, pull both reins out some
ten inches, then give the off rein a few inches
more, get your whip in your hand, mount to your
seat, sit down, put your reins in your left hand
with the index and middle finger between them,
and you will find yourself with both reins of
about the same length and of about the right
length. Another measure of the proper length
of the reins before mounting is to hold the reins
in the left hand, step back until you are on a line
with the horse's hocks, holding the left hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
close to the body. When seated the reins will be
of the right length (Plate XXIX.).</p>

<p>Always ask if everything is right before you
feel the mouths of the horses. The groom
may be just putting on a last touch, or he may
be looking the other way, as you give the signal
to start, and there follows a lame foot, or even
a knock-down; and so much depends upon a
fair start that it is worth some pains to get it.</p>

<p>The whip should be held at the place where
the ferrule goes round the handle, as all good
whip-makers make their whips to balance at that
point (Plate XXIX.). The knees and feet should be
together; the feet not poked out as though you
were standing on them, nor tucked under you
as though you were ashamed of them. You
will balance better if you sit straight with your
back hollowed in at the small of it. To lengthen
or shorten the reins put the right hand on the
reins in front of the left with the little and fourth
finger on the right hand or off rein, leaving the
left hand or near rein between the fourth and
middle fingers, and the thumb and index finger
over the same&mdash;the near rein (Plate XXIX.). You
may shorten the reins now, by just so much, as
you place the right hand in front of the left, by
sliding the left hand up to the right, and taking
your grip again. It is best to do this gradually,
taking in a little of the reins at a time, rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
than by taking ten or twelve inches at a time.
Whether it be the left or the right hand that is
in front, the hand in front should for the time
being hold the reins. Never, under any circumstances,
get the thumb under the near rein nor
the little finger under the off rein, a very common
and faulty practice. The reason being that
in such a situation your right hand is hampered
in moving quickly, by having the thumb under
the rein, your left hand likewise by having the
little finger under instead of on top of the rein.
As all these movements should be made mechanically,
without looking at the reins, the fingers
should be so placed and kept that there is no
mixing up in the process. The right hand
indeed should do its fingering of the reins as
quickly and accurately as a practised pianoforte
player picks out and strikes his notes.</p>

<p>In stopping, place the right hand on the reins
from eight to ten inches in front of the left, as
described above, press the right hand in toward
the body while raising the left hand. If this is
not enough, hold the reins in the right hand, pass
the left in front, and take in more rein, the right
coming forward again to the front place. In an
emergency, it is always safest to pull the reins
through from behind with the right hand (Plate
XXIX.). To the inexperienced this is quicker and
safer, whether with two reins or four. In driving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
a pair of "roadsters," so called, they are put to
with their heads far apart, and bitted with plain
snaffle-bits. Such a pair must be driven with two
hands, one rein in each hand, in order to keep an
even pressure upon their mouths.</p>

<p>Before you have gone very far along a straight
road you will notice, unless you are driving a
thoroughly made, mannered, and properly put
together pair, that one horse does more work
than the other, or that one horse seems to be in
front of the other. This is caused by the formation
of the horses, the length of the traces, the
coupling-reins. Traces stretch with wear, and
when this has become apparent, the shorter traces
should be used on the inside; if they are on the
outside, it is easy to see that this will put the pull
on the collar where it should not be, and gall the
shoulders. The lazier or shorter horse should be
in shorter traces. As to the coupling-reins, this is,
strange to say and to see, a part of the harness
that many drivers of horses never examine, and
never alter, any more than they think of trying
to change the diameter of their wheels. As a
matter of fact, the coupling-reins are the key to
the problem of driving a pair or a four comfortably.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">If you will examine a pair of two-horse reins,
you will notice that they are just like the two reins
for one horse&mdash;one rein goes on the outside of
the bit of one horse, and one goes on the outside
of the bit of the other horse. These are called the
draught-reins. But there is a marked difference,
for on each of these reins is buckled another
rein, called the coupling-rein; the one on the left
rein goes over and is buckled on the inside of the
bit of the right-hand horse, and the coupling-rein
of the right rein goes over and is buckled on the
inside of the bit of the left-hand or near horse.
In buckling these coupling-reins to the bits, if one
horse is more up-headed than the other, let his
coupling-rein be on top, so that he will not annoy
the other horse by jerking up the other's coupling-rein.
The adjustment of these reins should be
suited to the conformation and disposition of the
horses, and it is in this adjustment that the experienced
whip makes himself and his horses comfortable,
by making them go together, and go
level. No two horses suit each other exactly as
to length of body or neck, or the way of carrying
the head, and yet you may see dozens of pairs of
reins where the coupling-rein buckles have apparently
never been changed! The buckles of
the coupling-reins should be near enough to the
hand in pair or four driving&mdash;say eighteen inches&mdash;to
enable one to change the couplings from the
driving-cushion. In most harnesses there are
two or three holes in the billet that buckles to the
bit, so that the length may be changed also at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
bit. There are arguments for and against this
practice of having holes in the billet. It is said
that this makes it easy to change a coupling from
the ground; on the other hand, an ignorant groom
may make the change there unknown to the
coachman, and thus cause confusion. Take your
choice!</p>

<p>The object of these two inside, or coupling,
reins is to hold the horses together, at the head, of
course, and they should be so adjusted that an
even pressure is brought to bear on both sides of
the horses' mouths, so that they will go straight,
and do each his share of the work. If horses
were all alike, it would be easy enough to buckle
these coupling-reins in the same hole on each
draught-rein, and your horses would be level.
But suppose we have two horses, one of which,
the near horse, carries his head higher than the
other and out farther than the other. If these two
are to go level, the near horse must have his reins
longer than those of his mate. Up and down the
draught-reins are punched some fifteen holes
in four-in-hand harness, fewer in pair-horse harness,
and an inch apart, and the coupling-reins can
be buckled longer or shorter by buckling up and
down these reins. In the case we are describing,
we must of course let out the coupling-rein of the
up-headed, near side horse, say three holes, and
(remember that the near side coupling-rein is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
one buckled on to the off side draught-rein and
<i>vice versa</i>) take up the near side coupling-rein
the same number.</p>

<p>It must be remembered in this operation, however,
that the shortening of the coupling-rein
brings the horses' heads nearer together, and if
they were going properly, parallel to the pole, and
at the right distance apart, before one coupling-rein
was shortened, then, if this relative position
to one another is to be maintained, the other
coupling-rein must be let out an equal number of
holes.</p>

<p class="pbq">"When the horses are working exactly alike, the reins are
as shown by the heavy lines; <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are the two sides of the
off horse's bit, and <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> the two sides of the near horse's
bit. The two outside or draught reins run straight to the
coachman's hand, viz. <i>AM</i> and <i>DN</i>. The coupling-reins are
<i>CM</i> and <i>BN</i>, buckled to the draught-reins <i>M</i> and <i>N</i>. If the
off horse bends his neck so as to bring his head nearer to his
body, both the reins which run to his bit will be too slack,
and he will run forward and do more than his share of the
work, while the near horse is held back. To prevent this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the off horse's coupling-rein to <i>BN</i> is shortened by running
it up the draught-rein to <i>N'</i>, the last hole, until it comes just
tight to the bit; but this obviously leaves the off draught-rein
<i>AM</i> as slack as it was before, so that the coachman has to
draw his hand back to bring it to bear upon the bit at <i>A'</i>. In
so doing he draws back the coupling-rein <i>CM</i> and pulls the
head of the near horse to the inside. To prevent this the
coupling-rein <i>CM</i> must be let out on its draught-rein exactly
as much as the other coupling-rein has been taken up, which
is equivalent to pulling back the draught-rein, whereupon the
coupling-reins will have the positions shown by the dotted
lines with the buckle of <i>C</i> rein in the first hole, and all the
reins will act evenly upon both horses, notwithstanding that
the mouth and bit of the off horse is nearer to the coachman's
hand than that of the near horse."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fairman Rogers</span>, "A
Manual of Coaching."</p>

<p class="p1">The most common fault in adjusting coupling-reins,
next to that of having one horse in advance
of the other, is that of having the horses
coupled too closely, or too loosely, together;
in the first case the horses must go awkwardly,
with their heads too close together, with a tendency
to make them stumble, and in the other,
with their heads yawing apart, and not under
proper control. Some horses are greatly irritated
by being made to go on one side of the bit only,
and often enough a pair going all sorts of ways
will settle down and go well enough where their
coupling-reins are so adjusted that they can go
level, with an equal pressure of the bit on both
sides of the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>The matter of bearing-reins has been discussed
already, but it is worth repeating over and over
again, especially in the case of pair-horse driving,
that bearing-reins should never be omitted. The
pole-end, or his mate's bridle, offer various opportunities
to a nervous horse who throws his head
about to catch his bit or some part of his bridle,
and tear it off or break it; and a bitless and
bridleless horse is an equine anarchist, beyond
human power of judging or controlling. Where
you have whiffletrees in front of you, it is easy to
see which horse is doing too much or too little
work; but when in heavy harness, with traces
fixed to roller-bolts, the traces and reins must tell
the story. The object in this form of driving is,
of course, to make both horses do an equal amount
of work, uphill and down, and to keep them going
at an even pace.</p>

<p>In determining which horse to put on the near
side and which on the off side, several things
should be taken into consideration. First, in this
country we turn to the right, and as most roads
are made with a crown in the centre rather than
absolutely level, the off horse or horse on the
right-hand side has a little more work to do, in
that he must do most of the pulling, when the
carriage turns off to the right, and must then be
pulled back again. Therefore the bigger or
stronger horse of the two may go on that side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
Second, if one of the horses is more nervous or
more inclined to shy than the other, he is better
off on the off side, where he is less in contact with
passing horses, vehicles, automobiles, and the like.
So far as the matter of punishment with the whip
is concerned, in pair-horse driving it is as easy to
get at one as the other, though some people prefer
to have the less amenable animal of the pair
on the off side and under their hand. It is much
better for the horses, if other things are equal, to
change them about, so that they go one day on
one side and another day on the other. Horses,
particularly in the city, where the tendency is to
pole them up tightly,&mdash;too tightly,&mdash;so that they
may be easily handled in the crowded streets, are
apt to get into bad habits if driven always on the
same side. They get one-sided mouths, hit themselves,
but apparently brighten up, as though refreshed,
when changed about.</p>

<p>It is generally accepted as an axiom, that horses
should be as close to their work as possible. As
a matter of fact, this makes little difference to the
draught of the vehicle; but it does undoubtedly
make a very great difference in backing, starting,
turning, and the general management of the horses
by the coachman, and on that account it is well
to have your horses as close to the vehicle, and
to your hand, as possible.</p>

<p>Before going into details as to the handling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the reins, one very important error should be
noticed at the start. Driving is not knowledge of
how to hold the reins, how to give the "offices"
to make "points," etc., but real driving is the
knowledge and practical experience of all those
things which come before you get up on to your
vehicle at all. The writer was seated beside the
driver of an omnibus in London some ten years
ago, at a time when everything pertaining to the
handling of horses in harness was a keen interest.
The heavy buss with its load of passengers was
stopped and started and guided through the heavy
traffic of Piccadilly without fuss or trouble and
without jar to the passengers. When I complimented
the Jehu on his work, he replied, "Well,
you see, sir, there's plenty of drivers about, but
there's not many of us coachmen left!" That is
the gist of the matter. A coachman is one who,
through knowledge, and experience, and natural
ability, keeps his horses, passengers, and himself
comfortable and safe while doing the best attainable
work with least effort to all concerned. The
driver is a mere steerer of horses by artificial
shortening and lengthening of reins that he has
been taught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a><br /><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It would be a trifling task to write a book
on driving for those who only wish to become
drivers; but it is no small matter even to hint
at the variety of knowledge necessary to one who
wishes to become even a moderately good coachman.
Now that we have arrived at this subject
of the handling and fingering of the reins, it must
not be overlooked that this is literally the superficial
part of the business, and if it is built upon a
foundation of complete ignorance of the horse, his
house, his harness, his history, and his physical
make-up, it will always remain superficial and
unsatisfactory. On the other hand, once these
fundamental matters have been studied and
understood, the handling of the reins becomes
all-important to the coachman. First of all, spare
no pains to get your reins in your left hand at
the proper length, and once there they should be
kept there. All the nicety of driving depends
upon this. If the reins must be lengthened and
shortened every few minutes, none of the directions
to follow can be of much use. Such give
and take as there must be between hand and bits
should come wholly from the gentle give and
take of the wrist. When the reins are to be
shortened for going down hill, and lengthened
again going up, the two methods for this
operation have been described in the chapter
on driving one horse. With a nicely bitted
pair, the turn to the left and the turn to the
right may be made by turning the hand as
directed in the same chapter. Where more
power is required, the turn to the left may be
made by looping or making "points" to left or
right as may be required. The point to the left
is made by taking the upper or near rein with the
thumb and index finger or with the little and
fourth fingers of the right hand, pulling it back a
few inches, according to the angle of the turn,
and placing the bight of the rein under the
thumb (see Plate XXX.). Close the thumb down
on the reins and hold it there until your horses
have fully responded, then lift the thumb and this
near rein slips back into place of itself. Be careful
to keep your point under the thumb until the
turn is made, otherwise&mdash;and a common fault&mdash;the
slackening of this rein will land you in the
middle of the turn with the horses going exactly
the other way. By thus looping your rein the
left hand is kept steadily in its place, and the right
hand is entirely free to be used in case the
other horse is too quick or too sluggish. If the
off horse is inclined to go round too fast and
shove his mate over, the right hand is there to
put on his rein and restrain him. If, on the other
hand, he is too sluggish, and does not obey
quickly enough, your right hand is there to
touch him up with the whip and make him do
what is required of him. In turning to the right,
the under rein or off rein may be looped in the
same way, but this time under the index finger,
rather than the thumb, though the thumb may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
be used, and the turn made to the right in the
same fashion and with the same methods as
before. Although the making of points and opposition
and so on are usually for four and
tandem driving, it is much neater and quieter to
use these methods on a much smaller scale for
your pair. It is quieter and less conspicuous
than pulling the reins and gets one in, and keeps
one in, the valuable habit of fingering the reins
accurately, quietly, and mechanically, leaving the
eyes and attention for other and more important
matters.</p>

<p>Whenever a loop is taken or any other indication
attempted of what you want your horses to
do, avoid confusion by giving a variety of signals
at one and the same time. For example, in taking
a loop, if you allow your left hand to slide forward
to receive it under the thumb instead of
letting the right hand bring it back, you slacken
your reins and your horses start forward just when
they should be well in hand. If a horse feels this
tightening of the rein from the point you are
making and then feels the pressure lessen, he will
whip back again; hence the necessity for holding
your point until the horses have responded fully.
It is much better to hold a point too long than to
let it go before its work is done. In pulling reins
toward you, do not draw the rein to one side,
thus drawing the hands apart, but pull directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
toward the body&mdash;straight back, in short. Never
let your right hand get so far away from the left
that it cannot be used instantly when wanted. If
you are a beginner, get a steady pair and keep at
this fingering of the reins; the starting, with
pressure of the right hand in front of the left just
enough to feel their mouths; the stopping, with
right hand properly grasping the reins; the points
to the left and the right, and the shortening of the
reins, until these matters are done quickly and
automatically without the necessity of looking at
your hands at all. And though this be a treatise
on driving, let us be frank and say that a good
teacher is better than any book. Sit beside a
good coachman as often as you can and watch
him like a lynx. Get a good coachman to sit
beside you and tell you and explain to you; then
go back to your book again, and you will get much
more out of it than before. A brilliant Frenchman
has said that he studied books while he
was waiting to study men. The book-learning is
far more valuable when supplemented by practice.
On the other hand, it is only the very ignorant in
these days who do not make what use they can
of other men's experience and practice, by studying
up in books any subject in which they are
interested.</p>

<p>To read a good book on driving helps your
teacher even more than it helps you, in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
you have at least some inkling of the elementary
principles of what he is to teach you.
Even with one horse these manœuvres may be
gone through with, and every turn, and start, and
stop, made with the same nicety and care, as
though one were driving his drag at a meet of the
coaching-club.</p>

<p>Mr. Underhill's sumptuous book is entitled
"Driving for Pleasure." There is an amusing
chapter to be written on Driving for Punishment,
with illustrations from life, if one cared to write
it. The distortions of face, hands, and body,
through trying to do simple things in an awkward
and roundabout way; the mixing up of whip,
hands, and reins, through not having toiled sufficiently
over the elementary stages of the art of
driving; the brake on or off when it should not
be, and a complete loss of head, the horses any
way, and their owner in roseate confusion, are
phases of the driving for punishment one often
sees. And be it said, driving is a punishment indeed,
when bad bitting, ill-fitting harness, horses
badly put to, and awkward handling of reins,
whip, and brake, are of one and the same
combination.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pn center">DRIVING FOUR</p>

<p class="pn p2">About the year 1840, with the advent of railways
in England, coaching, for a time at least,
practically came to an end. Before that time, all
transportation of passengers, mail, and small
merchandise was by coach. The mail-coaches
were under government control, and as representing
the Sovereign, had rights and privileges, and
were entitled to respect. Many of the present-day
usages are reminders of that time, and relics
of ancient customs. That other vehicles should
give way to the mail-coach, that the constables
should salute as it passed, that other coachmen
should recognize it by saluting, can be readily appreciated.
In England to-day, the coaches running
out of London with their loads of passengers,
bent on a day's pleasant outing merely, are treated
much in the same way. All but surly drivers
make way for them, the police salute, many of the
other coachmen salute, and the forms of what
were once realities still obtain.</p>

<p>Both there and here many people forget, that
these coaches must take out a license, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
bound by the laws governing other vehicles
employed for the transportation of passengers.
The coach put on each season by the Coaching-club
of New York, and which has run latterly
from the Holland House to Ardsley on the Hudson
and return, although it may be done primarily
for sport, is none the less governed by the terms
of its license. Hence it is that a good sportsman,
in undertaking such a duty, goes rain or shine,
makes a point of being on time, insists upon
promptness, not as a fad of his own, but because
these are the implied articles of agreement between
him and the city when he takes out his
license. Like all other good sport, there is an element
of hard work and tyranny in it. The coachman
must at all times obey the laws of the sport.</p>

<p>To buy, train, and drive the horses, and carry
out a successful schedule for six weeks or so, with
the innumerable details involved, is a task requiring
knowledge, experience, tact, and patience.
The man who can do this may be said to have
passed his postgraduate examination as a first-class
coachman.</p>

<p>There are not many men who can do that, but
there is plenty of sport to be had in driving four
horses, this side of that supreme ability. Men who
lack the time, money, knowledge, and experience
to put a coach on the road may still, with benefit
to themselves, and to the inmates of their stables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
drive four horses. Although there was coaching
in a sense in this country, from Revolutionary
times and before (see Chapter III.), the first regular
English coach sent to this country to be used for
pleasure driving was imported in 1860 by Mr.
Lawrence of Boston. The first public coach was
put on the road in 1876 by Colonel Delancey
Kane, and ran from the Brunswick Hotel, New
York, to Pelham.</p>

<p>Monotony probably destroys more people than
any one form of dissipation. Humanity wearies
of the round of duties day after day, and attempts
by drink, or dissipation, or by running away from
duty, to break in upon it or to break away from
it. It takes the very highest qualities to stick it
out, whatever may be the duty. Plato maintained
that change is rest. Many men work all the
time; their only rest is change of work. He is a
diplomat in life who remembers this dangerous
quality of monotony, and in his own life, and the
life about him, seeks to diversify it.</p>

<p>This principle can be applied to the subject of
driving as well, if not better, than to most others.
To drive one horse, over one road, day in and day
out, becomes a weariness to the flesh, instead of a
refreshment. If you have only one horse, you
can at least both ride him and drive him. If you
have two, you can drive them abreast as a pair, or
one in front of the other as a tandem, and both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
can be ridden. As soon as your stable enlarges
to four, you can have no end of variety if care
and patience are exercised. Strange to say, too,
the horses join in the fun. A horse likes a new
road and enjoys going in a new way. It will take
time and trouble to teach your horses to go tandem,
and in a four; but once they are taught, they
enjoy it quite as much as you do. Of course we
are writing now of those who wish to get practice
and pleasure out of their stables, not merely for
those who use their horses for purposes of transportation
only. Do not start out with the notion
that the only way to drive a tandem, or a four, is to
have exactly the proper vehicle, the right harness
to the shape of a buckle, and horses of just such
and such a character. The show ring is one thing;
driving for sport and pleasure is quite another.</p>

<p>Practically any man who will spend enough
money can win prizes in the show ring; and it is
only occasionally nowadays, when so much money
is spent for show-ring horses and equipages, that a
man of moderate means can hope to win in these
tournaments. He may by good judgment, in
buying and training, bring out a winner now and
then; but he has little chance against those who are
willing to pay any price for a ready-made winner.</p>

<p class="vh"><a name="ill522" id="ill522">522</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It is a good thing to know how horses and
vehicle should be turned out, even down to minute
details; but a book, a coach-builder, a harnessmaker
and a bank-account never yet made a
sportsman, at this, or any other game. As has
been said before in another chapter, "form" is
only rational when it is the proper clothing of an
idea; it is ridiculous and unworthy when it is
merely an idea of proper clothing.</p>

<p>Of tandem driving we have written in another
chapter. If you cannot have a four, costing, with
coach, horses, and harness, $15,000 or more, why
not have just as much sport, and far more valuable
experience, by a more economical arrangement?
Buy your horses with a purpose, to begin
with. Let the saddle-horses serve as leaders, the
blockier, heavier harness horses in the wheel. Or
if you run to smaller sizes, two of 15.1 in the wheel
and your polo ponies 14.2 in the lead, with a
pony break behind them, make a capital four.
If a second-hand harness is not procurable, terrets
on your wheelers' saddles and bridles make any
stout double harness serviceable; and an extra pair
of long reins and long traces fit out your leaders,
and there you are. Any man who can afford to
keep four horses can, if he will give the problem
time and trouble, have the practice of driving four.</p>

<p>Be it said at once that the best practice is that
of driving different teams every day, and that can
only be obtained where there is a good deal of
road coaching, and you are of an ability to be
permitted to drive. Next to that, probably, comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the experience and knowledge to be derived from
getting together, harnessing, bitting, and getting
to go, a four out of your own stable. Most books
and most teachers deal with the subject of driving
four as though appearances counted ninety-seven
per cent, and your own pleasure and profit three
per cent.</p>

<p>We are dealing with four-in-hand driving here
as a pastime, as an opportunity for variety in
your own driving, and as a refreshing change in
their way of going for your horses. Remember
always that it is not hard on, but good for, your
horses to give them variety of work. Horses
that are well housed, carefully fed and watered,
comfortably harnessed, and discreetly driven are
much better for change of scene and change of
work. This is not intended to mean that a light,
high-strung lady's saddle-horse is improved by
being put to work in the wheel of a break; or
that, of any horse, too much work or the kind of
work to which he is palpably unsuited should be
required of him. What is maintained here is
that very few owners of horses get all the fun
out of them that there is to be had.</p>

<p>These questions of pole-chains or leather pole-pieces,
this or that shape of bit,&mdash;so long as the
bit fits the inside of the horse's mouth,&mdash;housings
or no housings, stable-clothes or breeches and
boots, are all matters that come after, not before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
driving. The study of appearances comes after
the knowledge of essentials, not before. Appearances
as the result of knowledge take care of
themselves; but the mere study of appearances
teaches nothing. When you have learned to
harness and put to your horses, start, stop, turn
them, and keep them going evenly, at a proper
pace; and when your thong is as easily handled
as a walking-stick, then will be time enough to
investigate matters of buttons, hat brims, curve of
bit-shanks, whiphandles, cut of greatcoats, and
methods of saluting with the whip.</p>

<p>A certain amount of strength is the first
requisite in driving four horses. It is calculated
that the weight on the hand of the four reins,
averages from six to ten pounds for a light, well-bitted
team, less perhaps for a perfect team, and
running up as high as twenty-five, to even more,
pounds in holding a team going down hill. The
writer remembers the painful numbness of the left
forearm when he first drove four, years ago. It
is well to invigorate the arms, and to begin
a very little at a time at this exercise, or an
overdose at a first lesson may put the forearm
out of commission for some days. Pulleys,
dumb-bells, Indian clubs, or carrying a loaded
walking-stick will muscle up the arm and put it
in condition.</p>

<p>The use of the four-in-hand whip is so all-important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
that it should not be left to the last,
but practised persistently from the start. Many
teams, bitted and trained by professionals and
only driven in the park by their owners, require
almost no use of the thong; and as a result
many drivers of four horses can hardly put up
a thong, let alone use it with any success.</p>

<p>Place the point of the thong under the fingers,
grasping the stick, not at the end, but at the point
where the ferrule encircles it (Plate XXXI.).
Swing the point of the stick from left to right
with a slight downward movement, then make a
quick half circle from left to right and upward, and
your thong will curl around your stick three or
four times and hold there. The lower part of the
thong will curl around the handle the opposite way.
Between the upper and lower coil will hang a bight
of the thong (Plate XXXI.). Move your stick over
to the left or driving hand, pull out the lower coil
with the thumb and forefinger of that hand, and
place the point of your thong again under your
right hand, the thong now going around the stick
in the same direction all the way down so that
it is easily unwound when wanted (Plate XXXI.).
The point of the thong is more secure in your
right hand if it is wrapped a couple of times
around the handle, though there is high authority
against this practice, on the ground that it is not
so easy to unwind your thong when wanted. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
you are a beginner, you will find it safer to make
the couple of turns around the handle. Mr.
Bronson, who was one of the very best of our
American whips, held, and with justice, that the
point of the thong should not be wrapped around
the stick, maintaining that just when the hands
were needed it required two hands to undo it.
The whip should be held pointing upward and
to the left. When the thong hangs over the
middle of the back of the near wheeler, your whip
will be in about the right position.</p>

<p>The way usually recommended for putting up
the thong is to make a large S on the wall and
follow this with the point of the whip, beginning
at the bottom and moving across from left to
right. To do this, start slowly from left to right,
and let the upper curve be made with a turn of
the wrist which will bring the fingers uppermost
at the finish.</p>

<p>It is exasperatingly easy, and exasperatingly
difficult. Once you get the knack, it is like
skating and swimming, you wonder how you were
ever puzzled. If these directions are not clear,
get some one to pound it into you by persistent
instruction; for, of all awkward things, none is
more so than the confusion arising from a dangling
thong, that cannot be made to go up, and
stay up, where it belongs. Nothing but constant
practice makes one comfortable with the whip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
If you are driving in the country, unwind and
put up your thong constantly; even take out
your four-in-hand whip with one or two horses,
and practise, practise, practise. Some day, in a
crowded street or in the park, when a cut of the
whip is imperatively necessary and a quick return
of the thong to its place as necessary, you will not
regret a moment of the time spent in this way.
Do not trust to luck in this matter. What is
usually called "luck" is, after all, the happy way
ability and opportunity have of often meeting.
Keep your thong pliable, otherwise it will not
stay in its place and be difficult to put up.</p>

<p>In using your whip, make as little fuss and
noise as possible; each horse should be hit so
that the other three hear nothing and know
nothing. Do not flick a horse, but hit and draw
the thong at the same time, then it means something.
In putting up your thong, do not make
a flourish with the arm. It is just as easy to put
the thong up with the right elbow at the side.</p>

<p>The wheelers should be hit in front of the
pad, down the shoulder; it is better to hit the off
wheeler on the off shoulder if his mate is restive.</p>

<p>If there is kicking, the best punishment is a
cut over the ears. In hitting the off leader,
swing the point of your stick out to the right;
once the thong is unwound, make a turn, and
bring the stick forward quickly, when the thong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
will travel forward under the stick. Always aim
to hit a leader under his traces, and when you
hit him let him know that he has been hit.
Always aim farther ahead than you mean to hit.
You cannot go too far, and you may be short.
To catch the thong again, take it back, away
from your horses, and point the stick over your
left arm, allowing the thong to fall first, or point
your stick up, and let the thong slide down the
inside of it to your hand. Pull the thong through
with the finger and thumb of the left hand till
the point is within a few inches of the right hand,
then put up the thong as directed.</p>

<p>To hit the near leader is a little more difficult,
and a good reason, by the way, for putting the
lazier leader on the off side. Untwist your thong
as before on the right side of you, swing the thong
over all your horses so that it hangs on the left
side of the coach, then with a turn of the stick
shoot your thong as before, stopping the point of
the stick at about the pad of the near wheeler, when
the point of the thong will hit the near leader's
hocks. In getting your thong back from this
position, swing it from left to right over all your
horses, and point the stick again over the left
arm, when the thong will fall over the reins near
the hand or, if well done, into the hand. Then
proceed as before. The near wheeler may be
hit on the quarters also, by throwing the lash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
between the heads of the wheelers, though this
is condemned by many as a bad practice. This
needs practice, particularly in getting your thong
back to your hand.</p>

<p>Never attempt to use the whip while the right
hand is on the reins or holding a rein. First,
because you cannot use the whip with any effect,
and second, because you are sure to jab one of
your horses in the mouth by a jerk on the rein
you happen to be handling. See that your thong
is all clear before attempting to put it up. You
will find that it has a disconcerting way of catching
on the rein buckles, the handles of the foot-board,
or even on the lamps. If in using your thong it
catches in any part of the harness, treat it gently;
do not pull at it, which only makes it hold faster;
and if it will not come loose by these measures,
send the servant down to loosen it. If your
thong catches in boughs of trees or the like, do
not hang on to the stick, but let the whole thing
go and send back for it.</p>

<p>In saluting, drop your whip into your left hand
and take off your hat if it be a lady you would
recognize. Few things are more parochial in
these matters than to see a man making a conspicuous
sword salute with his whip to a lady
who is either in another vehicle or on the road.
In saluting others, a movement of the whip from
left to right with the forearm is enough. It has
the merit of not taking the right hand far from
the reins, and is less conspicuous than the use
of the whip as a sword, by bringing the handle
up to your chin.</p>

<p class="p1">It is an old-time custom among the drivers of
road-coaches in England to take off the hat to
a chimney-sweep. Just why it is supposed to
bring luck, like killing spiders in the morning
and letting them live in the evening, and fifty
other fancies of a like kind, the writer cannot
explain. In approaching trouble, where you are
likely to need your thong, unwind it and hold
only the point under your thumb. A cut in time
may save a whole side of harness!</p>

<p>Four horses with a heavy vehicle behind them&mdash;a
drag weighs from twenty-one to twenty-four hundred
pounds, a public coach from twenty-four hundred
to three thousand pounds&mdash;and loaded with
passengers occupies a good deal of space, gathers
a good deal of momentum, and needs a good deal
of skill in its governor. The very assumption
of the task of driving is a great responsibility.
No man should undertake it lightly.</p>

<p>To know the whole game, and to do it supremely
well, requires many, many months of
constant and studious practice. The easier it
looks, the more capable is the man who makes
it look easy to you. Do not for a moment be
deceived into thinking that it is really easy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
consequences of thinking so may contain, not only
disasters of the most awkward kind, but death also.</p>

<p>Begin at the very beginning, with the harnessing
and putting to of your horses. Depend only
upon a good and trustworthy builder for your
vehicle. If you buy a second-hand one, choose
it with a friend who knows what such a vehicle
should be, and then have it gone over thoroughly
by your carriage builder.</p>

<p>Of the harnessing of the horses we have already
written. It needs to be added, that in harnessing
four all the details of fit and stoutness of leather
and proper bitting should be more than ever
looked after. Before your horses are brought out
have the pole in its place and the lead-bars hung
on the pole-hook. Have a look yourself to see
that the pole-pin is securely in its place. Bring
out your wheelers, hook the pole-chains to the
kidney-link ring, giving ample room to back them
so that the traces may be put over the roller-bolts,&mdash;outside
trace first, then the inside one,&mdash;then
tighten the pole-chains by passing the hook
through the kidney-link ring from the inside out
so that it will come out away from the pole. The
length of this chain must depend upon the good
or bad roads you are proposing to drive over, and
upon other things already discussed (Chapter XIII.).
When your horses are poled up, they are drawn
toward the pole, and you will notice that the inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
trace is therefore shorter than the outside trace.
This difference should be taken up by enlarging
the inside roller-bolt by wrapping it, never by
punching holes in the trace, and thus weakening
it. Then fasten the coupling-reins to their bits,
and fasten your reins over your off wheeler's pad-terret,
or let them be drawn through above the
trace and tug-buckle from the front, back.</p>

<p>Then bring out your leaders and fasten their
traces to their bars. The leaders may be put to
with their traces on their own bars; with the traces
crossed on the inside, each horse working off his
mate's bar; with the traces crossed, but each horse
working off his own bar. The first is best for well-trained,
evenly working horses. The second is
advocated by those who consider that this method
makes the work more even, and keeps the lazy
horse up to his work. The third is mainly to keep
the leaders more together. The bars of the leaders
may be fastened together with a strap for the same
reason. Never use a chain for this purpose as, in
case of a leg over the trace or any similar accident,
a chain cannot be cut and promptly undone.</p>

<p>This lapping of the traces is a matter each man
should work out for himself, after noticing how
his particular leaders go most comfortably. This
lapping of the traces also keeps the traces away
from the horses' sides, and in hot or muddy
weather this is a consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>Buckle your coupling-reins to the bits, run them
through their terrets, and, together with the wheel-reins,
push them through from in front above the
trace and tug-buckle of the off leader.</p>

<p>Put up your thong, lay the whip over the
wheelers' backs, and as a precaution push the end
of it between the back-strap. If your whip is in
the socket, it is in your way in getting up, it may
be broken by your passengers, or it may be played
with by an ignorant passenger and dropped, or at
any rate, the thong loosened. If the whip is
placed across the toe-board no one can mount to
the box-seat while it is there. If you are driving
alone and studying your team, the whip is better
on the toe-board, where it is not easily displaced
and does not annoy the wheelers; otherwise the
best place is across the backs of the wheelers. A
piece of steel covered with leather on the lead-reins
(Fownes of London used ivory) just in front
of the coupling-buckle prevents these slipping
through the lead-terrets, as may easily happen if
either horse plunges or hangs back.</p>

<p>If no bearing-reins are used, the throat-latches
should be snug, since they alone hold the bridle
on the horse's head. In breaking in a team,
bearing-reins properly adjusted do no harm and
are a safeguard. If necessary, start with them
very loose and shorten them when the horse is
warmed up, and his neck muscles are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
pliable. If the bearing-reins are fastened up
before the start, there will be backing, rearing, and
jibbing, all of which may be obviated by tightening
the bearing-reins after the start.</p>

<p>If you are to drive over good level roads, your
wheelers may be placed as near the coach as will
enable them to go at a good gait without hitting
the splinter-bar or wheels. The length of wheel-traces
should be about ninety-seven inches, of the
lead-traces about ninety inches. With smaller
horses the traces are, of course, proportionately
shorter. A long drawn out team is hard on the
arm and hand, not so easily manœuvred, and,
being farther from their work and from you, not
so likely to be easily handled.</p>

<p>On Western roads in this country, the four
horses are put much farther from the coach and
from one another, and given plenty of leeway as
to traces and pole-chains. Driving over their
heavy, rough roads necessitates this. If one of
our compactly harnessed teams attempted to work
over their roads, the coach, passengers, and
horses' shoulders would be badly racked. Indeed,
it is to be doubted whether closely harnessed
horses would not pull one another down. The
experienced coachman from the East does not
sneer at the long drawn out teams in the West;
nor does the Westerner sneer at the closely coupled
teams of the East. Each is adapted to do its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
work. It is only the neophyte who sneers here
or elsewhere, and a stupid neophyte at that; for to
sneer at ignorance is stupid, and to sneer at
stupidity, ignorant.</p>

<p>Now that you have your horses harnessed to
your vehicle, have another look round, for at this
business a quiet start is more than half the battle,
and it is worth while to see to it that you may get
away without at once stopping, to arrange something
about the harness that has been neglected.</p>

<p>Now step back to the off wheeler's quarter, and
with the right hand take hold of the leaders'
reins and place them in the left hand where they
belong, with the forefinger between them; then
take the wheelers' reins, and place them in the
left hand with the middle finger between them.
You will then have: near leader's rein over forefinger,
off leader's rein under forefinger and on
top of the near wheeler's rein; the near wheeler's
rein over the middle finger, and under the off
leader's rein, and the off wheeler's rein under the
middle finger. Then with your right hand pull
out twelve to eighteen inches of both off reins;
see that the buckles of the wheel-reins and the
stitchings of the lead-reins are at an even distance
from the left hand, so that when you are seated
on the box the reins will be level. It saves time,
trouble, and embarrassment to be able to do this
quickly and accurately. If you are beginning or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
out of practice, it is well to get up and down with
the reins until they are the proper length in your
hand.</p>

<p>Then put the reins in the right hand exactly
as they were in the left (or one finger lower
down, so that the forefinger is free to hold on
in getting up; this is advised by some coachmen,
but is not necessary), throw the ends of the
reins over your right arm, take your whip in your
right hand, and you are ready to mount. To do
this, put your left foot on the hub of the wheel,
right foot on the roller-bolt, left foot on the step,
and right foot on the foot-board, using your
left hand to hold on with and leaving the right
hanging down. Sit down at once, for, having
climbed so high, it would be humiliating to
tumble off if a horse started. Then put the
reins back in the left hand, where you should
find them all of about the proper length (Plate
XXXII.). If they are not, get them level without
touching the mouths of the horses. In taking
the reins from their place to put them in the
hand, it is usual to drop the ends on the ground.
If, however, you are on a muddy street or wet
pavement, put the ends of the reins over the little
finger of the right hand, which will keep them
out of the mud and wet while you are arranging
them in your hand to mount.</p>

<p>Another way of taking up the reins is, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
of drawing out the two off reins before mounting,
to allow the two off reins to run through the
fingers as you mount to the box, which has, to be
sure, the advantage of keeping control of all four
horses from the moment you take up the reins.
It is rare that a man drives four without men at
his horses' heads when he gets up, and for the
beginner, at any rate, the first-mentioned method
is the simpler of the two.</p>

<p>Start quietly. Feel your horses' mouths
gently as a reminder that something is coming,
give the word, let them have sufficient rein, let
the wheelers into their collars first, and go off
quietly at a walk. If you are driving a green
team, or a mean team, or a team you are making,
always start from the stable yourself. Even if
your coachman is a better coachman than you are,
it is best to get away with them yourself, and to
keep them amenable from the start. Although it
is advised here to let the wheelers start the coach,
the ideal way is to let all four horses feel their
traces at the same moment; but it is only under
ideal circumstances and with an ideal team that
all four horses will dip into their collars at the
same instant, and walk off with the coach, without
so much as a flurry or a shake of the head at
starting. Such horses are too good to be true,
and need very little driving.</p>

<p>Let the rugs or quarter-blankets be taken off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
quietly, not grabbed off as a sort of "get-up"
signal, and if your horses are at all inclined to
waver, let the grooms run ahead a few steps so
that the horses can see them and be tempted to
go on with them, and then, the team fairly started,
they can drop back and take their places on the
coach. Let them have their heads at the start
and get them in hand after they are all in the
traces. By checking a horse suddenly at the
start, with a too tight rein, or jabbing a leader
under the tail with the pole, or, worst of all,
forgetting to take the brake off and jerking the
whole team back on their haunches at the start,
you may, you will indeed, so irritate your horses
that it will take your gentlest and most skilful
behavior to get them right and going pleasantly.</p>

<p>The writer knows one mare at least who behaves
perfectly if everything goes smoothly at the
start, but if she is upset at the start, the whole
drive is spoilt by her behavior; nor is she appeased
till safely back in the stable. So, by all
means, use every endeavor, every artifice even, to
get a good start.</p>

<p>As was duly emphasized in Chapter XIII., by
far the greater part of the comfort and skill in
driving depends upon the give and take of the
left hand from the wrist, or with a slight movement
forward or backward of the hand itself.
Turning the left hand up or down with a movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
to the right or left will, if your horses are
well in hand, guide them to the right or left. In
starting, you are usually on one side or the other
of the road. To bring your horses over, two small
points to the left with the near lead-rein under the
thumb, the near wheel-rein under the forefinger;
or if to the right, the off lead-rein under the forefinger
and the off wheel-rein under the middle finger
will give the direction, and, once they are where
you want them, the reins slip out, and you have had
the right hand free to be used if necessary. Or,
turning the left hand down with the knuckles toward
the horses, bringing the hand at the same time back
to the left hip, will take them to the right; while
turning the left over, the knuckles toward you,
and the hand moved toward the body, will turn
them to the left. This movement of the left hand
up or down shortens or lengthens the near lead-rein.</p>

<p>There is an objection to moving the left hand
about much, and turns to the left and right are
best made by "points" or "loops." Before turning
anywhere, always have your leaders well in
hand. If they have hold of the pole-end, the
wheelers are helpless to turn the coach. To turn
to the left, take the near lead-rein with the three
lower fingers of the right hand and draw it back,
catching it under the left thumb, holding it fast till
your team has responded (see Plate XXXII.). To
turn to the right, do the same thing with your off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
lead-rein, holding it either under the thumb or
under the forefinger of the left hand (see Plate
XXXII.). Under the forefinger is better, since the
rein is then in its proper place to run out, just as
in the former case under the thumb is better for the
same reason. Never pull a rein off to the side, but
always straight back toward you, so that the hands
may never get too far away from one another.
Do not spoil your point by letting the left hand go
forward to meet it, but bring the point back with
the right hand, keeping the left hand in its place.</p>

<p>As soon as horses go much together as four,
they get to know the signals of the reins and
sometimes respond too quickly. This is especially
so of the wheel horses. As soon as they
feel the lead-rein moving in their head terret, they
begin to turn toward it. In going round corners
this results in the wheelers going round too
quickly, and perhaps running the coach on the
curb or against a post or pillar. An easy way to
avoid this is by making an "opposition point" so
called. Before giving the office to your near
leader, and making the point with your near lead-rein
to turn to the left, take up the off-wheel rein
and hold it over the forefinger of the left hand
(Plate XXXII.), then make your point, and with
one hand your leader is going round to the left,
your wheelers are kept away from the corner, and
you have your right hand to use on the reins, or
with the whip to urge the wheelers round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>In turning to the right, the same thing may
be done by taking the near wheeler's rein and
passing it over the thumb of the left hand, then
point to the right (Plate XXXII.), and again you
have your whole team in one hand and doing your
bidding. In turning a team off to the left, in
order to pass another vehicle, or in any case
where the turn is a slight one and to be made
quickly, put the right hand on the two near reins
with the middle finger between them, and as you
draw them toward you let the left hand advance.
Place the right hand on the two off reins with
the fourth finger between them, and repeat the
same manœuvre to go to the right. Put the right
hand well in advance of the left in doing this,
and pull directly toward you, otherwise you will
pull the reins out of the left hand and spoil the
whole movement by contradictory instructions to
the horses' mouths. In pulling up to the left, you
may place both near-reins well over the thumb,
and then use the right hand as usual in stopping;
this will bring your team over, and stop them at
the same time (Plate XXXII.).</p>

<p>It is obvious that all these "oppositions" may
be made by using the right hand on the reins.
In most road driving this is done. There are
from time to time turns to be made round sharp
corners, into gateways, through narrow streets,
coming down hill, or with a dip down hill immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
after turning a corner, when the right
hand is imperatively needed. It is at such times
that to know how to make these "points" and
their "opposition" is very useful. The best way,
therefore, is in times of peace to prepare for war
by using these "points" and "oppositions" frequently
where they can be made easily and without
looking at the hands; then when you really need
them you know how without fumbling and flurrying
to do what is necessary.</p>

<p>When you wish to shorten your lead-reins,
take them clean out of the left hand, bring them
back the required length, and replace them. It
is better and safer, however, so far as possible, to
push these, and other reins when possible, back
from behind. To shorten the wheel-reins, push
them back one at a time&mdash;an awkward way&mdash;or
pull them both through from behind. The near
wheel-rein, being the most awkward rein to get
at, should be shortened by pulling it from behind.
To shorten any other of the three separately, take
it in the lower fingers of the right hand and push
it back the required distance. To shorten all the
reins, put the right hand on all four reins, little
and fourth fingers over both off reins, middle finger
between, and forefinger and thumb over the near
reins, and push them back a little at a time. As
has been said before, if in a hurry pull all four
reins back from behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>As the two reins together, the off-lead and
near-wheel, are the most troublesome to the
beginner, it is well to remember that if your
leaders are straggling to the left and your wheelers
to the right, pushing these two centre reins
back a little will put things straight. For the
opposite trouble, pulling them forward a little
will solve the problem. The leaders of a team
are there to help over heavy roads and in going up
hill; but as they have no pole to support them,
their position is the more tiring one, and they
should be cared for accordingly and not allowed
to pull all the time. In crossing gutters or hollow
places, be particularly careful to have your leaders
in hand, otherwise if they are straining on the pole,
the lift and jerk may break it. This is not an
uncommon accident, and a very awkward one.</p>

<p>Remember that because you are driving four
horses you have no peculiar rights and privileges
over other American citizens, though they be
driving only one horse or a donkey. The courtesy
of the road will usually give the heavy load
a chance, but you can only ask, you may not
demand it. On a public coach, making time and
carrying passengers for fare, the horn is both a
safeguard and a proper signal; but the tooting of
a horn on all occasions in park, village, and ordinary
road driving is almost an impertinence.
<i>Cessante ratione, cessat et ipsa lex.</i> If you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
have a horn for protection, drive up and down
your own back road until that necessity is passed.</p>

<p>In stopping, get ready in advance and slow
down gradually. Get your leaders back a little,
put your right hand on the reins as already described,
lift the left hand, push the right toward
you, and come to a stop with the horses as nearly
as possible in their bits and collars ready to start
again (Plate XXXII.). The man who can stop and
start without a jerk is a good workman already.</p>

<p>Before getting down, put on your brake, always
quietly, then shift the reins into the right hand
with the whip, step down, put the reins into the
tug-bearer as they were when you took them out,
lay your whip across the backs of the horses, and
your task is done.</p>

<p>If there is to be a change of horses, or you are
in your own stable yard at the end of the journey,
have your reins unbuckled, let the leaders' reins
be pulled through your hands by the grooms, then
throw down the wheel-reins, one on either side, or,
as circumstances of space demand, retain the wheel-reins,
and drive your coach where it is to stand
by the wheelers alone, after the leaders are out.
Above all things, do nothing in a hurry; remember
that you are captain of the ship and should not
leave it until everything is shipshape and in order.</p>

<p>Where you have but one man at your service,
he should stand at the heads of the wheelers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
where he can hold them by their heads and the
leaders by their reins. Never attempt to hold
or to stop a team by running to the heads of the
leaders. They cannot stop if they would, with
a coach and the two wheelers pushing them from
behind. Get to the heads of the wheelers and
stop them, and thus, if it is not too late to do it
at all, stop the whole four.</p>

<p>Keeping four horses up to their work, or well
in hand, does not mean that they should be all,
all the time, tugging at their traces. They should
be kept up to their bits all the time, otherwise
you have no control over them and no way of
signifying your wishes to them. If you have
fenced, you know how absolutely essential it is
to keep in constant touch with your opponent's
sword. You feel him by feeling his sword. I
have seen a skilful French officer fence blindfolded
with an inferior opponent, he demanding
only that he should be allowed to feel his opponent's
weapon at all times, except when he
thrust, or parried. He could apparently divine
what was coming by the feel of his opponent's
rapier on his own. The feel of the bit in the
horse's mouth is as important. You can guess
what the horse intends to do, and the horse
knows what you wish him to do. If the bit is
not on his bars with a gentle pressure all the
time you are driving him, you are cut off from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
any quick connection with him. This is what
it means to have your team in hand, that is, to
be in constant communication with your horses'
mouths. Most beginners, owing to the weight
of reins in their hands, and because their leaders
are so far away, either lug on the reins, mistaking
this for firmness, or they allow the reins to dangle.
You should feel each horse's mouth lightly,
but all the time. The lugging soon makes a
puller; while the latter carelessness produces what
is known as a "nigger-broke" horse, or one that
is lazy and never quickly obedient to the bit.</p>

<p>If you are getting together a team for yourself
and by yourself, therefore, it is far better to
drive each horse single until you know his mouth,
and then in pairs until you are quite familiar
with the way they like to go best as to bits,
coupling-reins, and the like. There are two
classes of people who have accidents: the beginners
who are rash, and the old hands who are
over-confident, and hence careless. When your
driving has gone smoothly for some time you
take less pains, a mistake is made, and trouble
follows. But even if carelessness does not result
actually in accident, remember that it is bad for
the horses not to be kept strictly up to the mark
whenever they are driven. The horses become
slovenly in their work all too quickly, if you are
careless in yours.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pn center">THE TANDEM</p>


<p class="pn p2">One horse driven in front of the other gave a
University wag the opportunity to nickname two
horses so driven a "tandem," from the Latin word
meaning "at length," as applied to time. This joke
has crystallized into a familiar English word, and
many tandem drivers to-day include all the Latin
in their vocabulary in this form of exercise.</p>

<p>The fundamental principles of tandem driving
are much the same as four-in-hand driving, except
that the horses turn more quickly, and with less
pressure on the reins, especially in the case of the
leader. The reins, too, are closer together in
the hand, making the fingering more difficult, and
the handling of a spirited leader is perhaps as
difficult and nice a task as any form of driving
affords.</p>

<p>Although the chief authority for this chapter,
T. Suffern Tailer, Esq., late the president of the
New York Tandem Club, decries the use of anything
but traces for the leader,&mdash;traces fastened to
the traces of the wheeler,&mdash;it is fair to the reader
to describe another method of harnessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>This method consists of having two swingle-bars,
one 2 feet 6 inches in length, the other about 2
feet in length. The first has a hook in front and
a chain at the back, about 1 foot in length. This
chain is hooked to a ring at the bottom of the
wheeler's hames, and at the end are two short
traces fastening to the wheeler's traces by two
rings, or loops, under the trace-buckles. The
second bar is attached by an eyelet to the hook
of the first bar; to this, of course, are attached the
leader's traces in the usual manner.</p>

<p>Advocates of this way of harnessing claim
that by this method the leader's traces may be
made almost as short as those of the wheeler,
and that there is far less danger&mdash;none, indeed&mdash;of
a leader getting his legs over a trace.</p>

<p>In tandem harness there should be as little
harness as possible, even breeching omitted,
except in a very hilly country. One of the advantages
of this form of driving sport is that, even
with a small stable and few horses, one may drive
tandem without any great extra outlay. The
wheeler's harness may be an ordinary set of single
harness, with double terrets in the pad, and terrets
above the blinkers, to carry the leader's reins.
The leader's harness may be the same, with a very
light pad, since the pad in the leader's case only
carries the traces. The traces of the leader have
spring-hooks which are fastened to the brass rings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
or loops, under the wheeler's trace-buckles. On
the leader's pad are two leather loops to carry the
traces, and over the leader's loins, a bearing strap,
just long enough to keep the traces level. The
reins should be light, strong, and of the same size,
and suited to the size of the coachman's hands.
It is hardly necessary to say that to fasten the
leader's traces to the ends of the shafts is suicidally
dangerous; but as it is sometimes done the
warning is needed.</p>

<p>The writer's own experience in driving tandem
has been confined mostly to a pony tandem, a form
of amusement strongly recommended by Lady
Gorgiana Curzon in the Badminton volume on
Driving.</p>

<p>Two ponies, a stocky, short-legged pony 14.2
in the wheel, and a breedier specimen of the
same height in the lead, make a pair that bowl
along at a good rate, are light in hand, and
give younger members of the family capital
practice in the handling of four reins in one
hand. If you have a Phidippides in the family,
by all means put him to work at tandem driving.
It is good for his courage, and may be good for
his conceit (Plate XXXIII.).</p>

<p>Every one who has driven tandem much,
and almost every one who has not driven tandem
at all, agree: the first that tandem driving
is excellent sport, and not dangerous; the latter
that it is a foolish waste of equine energy, and
very dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">All forms of driving are dangerous, from piloting
Dobbin in a farm-wagon, to driving a drag to
a race meeting, if the coachman is ignorant, careless,
and nervous. Even Dobbin may go down
on his knees, or shy, and run away, if he is not
looked after. But tandem driving is no more
dangerous than other forms of driving, if harness,
cart, and horses are suited to the sport, and the
coachman is forever vigilant. There is no doubt
but that most horses enjoy going this way, and
the change is good for them, and it is excellent
practice; none better, indeed, for their owner.</p>

<p>In putting two horses together in this fashion
the traces of the leader may be as short as possible,
say three feet from the nose of the wheeler
to the croup of the leader, when the traces are
taut. The leader, if a breedy-looking animal,
with good neck and shoulders, may wear to advantage
a breast collar, instead of a neck collar.
He may, indeed, be with propriety as lightly harnessed
as possible.</p>

<p>The origin of the tandem was a convenient
way of taking a hunter to cover by putting him
in the lead of a dog-cart, with his saddle and
bridle carried along in the cart. Even to this
day this pedigree of the tandem marks out the
proper proportions and proper qualities for both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
wheeler and leader. The leader may thus be
driven appropriately in a ring snaffle, although
probably the best bits are the Liverpool or Elbow
bits with the not-to-be-forgotten proviso that the
wheeler's bit should have a bar across the bottom
of it to prevent the wheeler catching the leader's
rein under the end of the cheek-piece of his bit&mdash;a
trick one of the writer's ponies soon learned,
and was much mystified for days to find that the
trick would not come off, after a bar had been
added to the bottom of her bit. If the wheeler
indulges in much shaking about of his head, he
should have both a light bearing-rein and a martingale.
The leader ought to be the type of
horse which needs neither of these fixtures.</p>

<p>The whip may be lighter than the coach-whip,
and 5 feet long for the stick, and 8 feet 6 inches for
the lash, if you are driving ponies; 2 feet longer
in the lash if driving full-sized horses.</p>

<p>Before attempting a tandem with any horses
you happen to have in the stable, it is well to do
a little training of the one you propose to use as
leader. With a pair of long reins you should
drive him with nothing behind him, so that he
may become accustomed to moving along with
no weight on his collar. Let the reins touch his
quarters so that he may become accustomed to
the loose traces in which he will go later. Some
horses take to this way of going like ducks to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
water, and make no objections and few mistakes
from the beginning; but it is best, in any case, to
do a little training before they are put together
in what must be a novel way to them. As the
pressure should be less, and the loops taken
smaller, in tandem driving, much of the turning
may be done by the turn of the wrist and the
moving of the hand from left to right, as described
in the chapter on driving one horse. In turning,
the points to right and left should be small, and
care taken to keep your wheeler from rushing his
corners, as he may so easily do with a two-wheeled
trap behind him. If your leader is going off to
the left too much and your wheeler to the right,
push your two centre reins back a little, and this
will straighten them out; or if the contrary is the
case, and your leader is going to the right and
your wheeler to the left, pull the two centre reins
out a bit. The two centre reins are, the upper
one, your off lead-rein, the lower one, your near
wheel-rein.</p>

<p>It is more than ever necessary that the left
hand should be kept in its place, and the reins
held firmly in their place, otherwise your team
will never be straight for long at a time. The
left hand should be held as in driving four.
When the right hand is used on all the reins, the
little and third fingers go over the two off side
reins, the middle finger over the near wheel-rein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
and the first finger over the near lead-rein, thus
giving the right hand control over each and all of
the reins. The two off side reins may be kept
together, for in tandem driving it is only necessary
to make "points" when turning practically
at right angles. The horses should follow one
another without making a break between your
leader and wheeler by having the leader at right
angles to the wheeler when making a turn. Too
large a loop taken with only one rein is very apt
to bring your leader around too fast and too
far.</p>

<p>Never under any circumstances have your lead
traces taut when making a turn, as you may thus
pull your wheeler off his feet, and in any case,
when the lead traces are taut, it is your leader,
and not you, who is in control. Though driving
tandem is similar in the manipulation of the reins
to driving four, it is on a miniature scale. Everything
must be done more gently, more quietly,
more quickly, and all loops or points need only
be of the smallest. The wheeler should start
and stop the cart, and once they are going, the
wheeler should follow directly behind the leader.
The reins in a tandem come into the hand
much closer together than in the case of a four,
where the horses, being spread out, the reins are
accordingly apart. This makes the handling of
tandem reins quickly, difficult. When wishing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
use the right hand, if the left be pushed forward
slightly it gives the right hand a chance to place
itself correctly on the reins, as the reins are
thus pushed slightly apart. In tandem driving
it is of supreme importance to be ready in advance.
Whether stopping, starting, turning, increasing,
or slacking your pace, your right hand
should not be fumbling to get itself on the right
reins, but should be there, and ready, before it is
required. A quick, nervous leader can turn, stop,
start, and back like a flash. If you are not ready
for him <i>before</i> he gets going, no mortal is quick
enough to catch him <i>afterwards</i>. The damage
is done, and your horses in a tangle while you are
still groping with your right hand for the proper
reins. In passing other vehicles, or any object
that you think may cause your leader to shy,
always have a small loop of that side rein under
your thumb, and your right hand ready to put on
the brakes on whichever rein requires it, instantly,
before either horse can make much of a <i>détour</i>. A
horse met at once with a rebuke is half persuaded
already to come to terms. The cart, if ponies
are driven, should not be too light nor too low.
With wheels 4 feet 9 or 10 inches in diameter,
the coachman's seat will be about 5 feet 4 from
the ground. The wider the cart, up to 6 feet
wide inside, the better, both for the comfort of
the passengers, and because a broad track lessens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
the danger of upsetting. The body of the cart
should be set as low on the axles as possible.</p>

<p>A cart with bent shafts pivoted on the front
part of the cart, and adjustable behind, with
wheels five feet high, and track five feet wide,
will accommodate anything, from 14.2 to 16
hands, and makes, if lightly built, a good all-round
two-wheel cart for all sorts of purposes.
A slant of from three to four inches for the driving
cushion makes a comfortable angle for the
seat. If necessary, have a movable foot-rest, but
on no account a rail for your feet. See, on this
subject, remarks in the chapter on driving one
horse. These descriptions and requirements do
not purport to guide one in setting up a tandem
for show purposes. This branch of the subject
is dealt with completely, and with experienced
competency, by Mr. Tailer in the next chapter.
But tandem driving is too good a sport to be
confined to the show ring. Any enterprising
horse owner may put to a tandem out of his
own stable without adding much to the expense
of his stable, while adding greatly to the variety
of sport to be got out of his establishment.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pn center">DRIVING TANDEM, BY T. SUFFERN TAILER, ESQ.</p>

<p class="ppq20 p1">"Not every path extends the same,<br />
But various are the roads to fame;<br />
With different eye the same pursuits we view,<br />
Nor all one wish with equal zeal pursue."</p>

<p class="pn p2">It is arranged, no doubt wisely, that happiness,
which is the universal aim of mankind, may be
pursued by numerous roads, and that they who
seek it on wheels may choose from a variety of
conveyances.</p>

<p class="b1">Some press forward to the goal astride the
bicycle, or in the automobile, for which vehicles
it may be claimed that at any rate they don't cost
much to feed; others drive furiously in a coffin-shaped
box within four "spider" wheels; and yet
others prefer,&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq00">"To dash along with four-in-hand, while others drive at random,<br />
In whiskey, buggy, gig or dog-cart, curricle or tandem."</p>

<p class="p1">According the "right of way" to this procession,
I at length claim the privilege to take my
pleasure in driving a tandem.</p>

<p>One of the first requisites of this is nerve,&mdash;an
indispensable requisite, in fact. It is the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
spice of danger that makes this form of driving
exciting; but for a man who has nerve, and
acquires the proper amount of skill, there is no
more danger in driving a tandem than any other
equipage in vogue. Fewer accidents befall experienced
tandem drivers than those who drive
any local style of turnout.</p>

<p>For example, a man in a road wagon of the
conventional style, with four wheels confining him
in a narrow box, when his horse bolts has no
means whatsoever of saving himself; whereas, in
a dog-cart, although when the wheeler goes down
he may get a "father and mother of a fall," he
does not part company with the vehicle.</p>

<p>It seems to be established that the most competent
authority on a subject is one who has
much theoretical, and little practical, knowledge
of it.</p>

<p>For a tandem set up on theories alone, the
horses must be a pair perfectly matched in figure,
height, color, and action; either, therefore, fit to
change places with, and to do the work of, the
other. Experienced tandem drivers whose opinions
are entitled to consideration dissent decidedly
from this view. They maintain that if the
wheeler, that holds the entire weight on descending,
and performs nearly all the work, on level
ground, for which great strength and straight
action are necessary, is the standard of the pair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
a leader patterned on this type will be too stout
and too coarse. If the leader, on the other hand,
in quality, figure, and action is of the perfect type,
he will be too light, and otherwise unsuited for
the wheeler's place.</p>

<p class="b1">For tandem carts of standard weight, the
wheeler, which is the chief factor or mainstay of
the tandem, should be 15.3 hands high, with a
well-cut head, deep, sloping shoulders, broad chest,
short, straight back, wide hips, and strong quarters
on short, strong legs. To prevent angles in, and
to afford direct draught of the driving-reins, the
head should be carried straight and naturally,&mdash;neither
with nose poked out in front, nor pointed
high like a "star-gazer's," nor yet drawn in to the
chest,&mdash;and he should be a fast and straight goer,
wasting none of his force in extravagant action.</p>

<p class="ppq20">"A roadster good, not straddling high,<br />
Nor shuffling low, I find thee;<br />
But stepping straight and cheerily<br />
Thou leav'st the miles behind thee."</p>

<p class="p1">The leader, whose duties seem to be ornamental
chiefly, he having nothing to carry but his
harness, little work to do except on heavy or hilly
roads, and nothing to hold down hill, need have
none of the qualities mentioned as indispensable
requisites in the wheeler.</p>

<p>With a wheeler, as before described, 15.3 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
height, I should choose a leader 15.2 or 15.2½;
a half or three-quarters thoroughbred, but with
plenty of substance and bone. He should have
high style and high action all round; rakish and
gamy in form, spirit, and action; the head lean
and thoroughbred looking; long, clean neck, with
good crest; head well up and nose a little out;
ears small, sensitive, and pointing to the front;
deep, sloping shoulders, high on the withers;
short, straight back; strong, muscular loins;
straight hips; strong in the hind quarters, with
muscles running well down. To this should be
added a light mouth, well bitted, responding with
the whole body to the lightest touch of the rein;
the manners and grace of a gentleman; good
sense and coolness in tight places, choosing often
his own way with courage and confidence,&mdash;a
rare and lovable thing in God's creation, but such
there be or may be made (Plate XXXVII.).</p>

<p>Of tandem carts there are various patterns, but
with the New York Tandem Club, the members
of which have been regarded as the best exponents,
in this country at least, of the proper way of
appointing a tandem, as well as of driving it, the
Whitechapel, and the dog-cart represented in
Henderson's admirable picture entitled "Going to
Cover," are the two designs in favor at the present
time.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Hitherto the former has been the most popular,
doubtless owing to its being the pattern adopted
by builders, but it has since yielded place in the
estimation of tandem drivers to the dog-cart described
(Plate XXXIV.); though both are, and will
continue to be, regarded as the highest types of
their respective kinds.</p>

<p>The Whitechapel cart derives its name from a
locality in the East End of London, not nearly
as aristocratic as Belgravia, and was originally
intended for some practical purpose, such as
hawking vegetables or milk, for example. It is
rude in character, and, like the hansom cab, not
susceptible of much refinement, and its primitive
style is by no means improved by rails, lamps,
and fittings of shafts, in bright metals.</p>

<p>Well horsed, with appropriate harness, aprons,
and a smart servant, and driven by an accomplished
whip, made up in sympathy, a Whitechapel
tandem is a most audacious "varmint"
turnout.</p>

<p>The shafts of a Whitechapel being straight, in
keeping with its sharp, rakish lines, and its
wheels being of proper height, a certain amount
of open space between the body and carriage is
unavoidable; but that objectionable feature may
be in some degree obviated, by painting the latter
in dark colors, with black striping, although primrose
and vermilion on the under-carriage are
colors very effective and pleasing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>A dog-cart of the design in the familiar print
referred to, as its name and the blinds in its panels
imply, was invented for the conveyance of dogs
inside, and is quite different in character, as it is
also superior in point of comfort, to a Whitechapel.</p>

<p>A slight bend in the shafts near their points
is favorable to closer relations of the body and
carriage parts than would be possible with
straight shafts, a desirable effect in carriage building
termed "shutting up the daylight."</p>

<p>The most effective colors for this cart are: for
the panels, which are carved in imitation of basket,
a straw or cream, and for the shafts, wheels,
etc., brightest vermilion striped with black.</p>

<p>Cushions of dark colors seem most appropriate
for a cart painted as described, as they are in
agreeable contrast; but, as they are affected by
exposure to dust, rain, and the sun, drab Bedford
cord is the material to be preferred.</p>

<p>The superior comfort of this dog-cart is attributable
to the construction of its body, which is
practically a box, open only at its ends on which,
the rails being bent outwards, the greatest seating
capacity is secured, and to the facility for getting
on and off, which is of importance on long journeys,
when the duties of the groom, who has been
sent forward in advance, are performed by the
passenger occupying the hind seat. The bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
vermilion and clean straw colors of this cart are
especially effective in competitions on the tan-bark
by gaslight, where dark colors show to less
advantage.</p>

<p>The cocking-cart (Plate XXXV.) is another
style, which from its very smartness and dangerous
height seems especially adapted to tandem driving,
and is best described as the front boot of a
coach on two wheels. A local tandem driver informs
me that he once proposed giving his London
builder an order for a cart of this kind, but
though the builder declared his readiness to undertake
its construction on the lines familiar to
him through his ancestors who built that sort
of breakneck vehicle, the customer was advised
"not to trust his life on such a tower upon
wheels."</p>

<p>The cocking-cart was used for conveying game
fowls to the cock-pit, on arriving at which destination
they were thought to be, from the shaking
up they had received on the journey, in prime
condition and temper for the coming battle.</p>

<p>Except to be used exclusively for fancy tandem
work, I would not advise the purchase of a cocking-cart,
as, for driving a single horse, it is not to
be compared with either a Whitechapel or a dog-cart.</p>

<p>There are still other patterns of carts, some of
which are very good, but I have described those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
I think best suited to tandem driving. Which of
the many kinds of draughts for carts is most practical
is a question giving rise to much discussion.
It must be admitted that, whichever is used, while
it may be placed a little below the level of the
hames-draughts, it should never be fixed above
that line.</p>

<p>An old tandem driver, to whose judgment I
defer, informs me that, having tried all sorts of
draughts, he prefers that from hooks fixed to the
cross-bar, which he used many years without a
galled shoulder, but which would be unsuited to
carts with very high wheels and high, straight
shafts. If a horse in a well-fitting collar is properly
put to a cart by his harness, with saddle
firmly fixed in its place, and back-band loose to
allow the shafts to play in their tugs, he will work
from fixed draughts without being injured. Ring
hames-draughts, of old style, which are most practical
of all, will contribute more to a horse's comfort
than all the new fads in drawing-hooks and
bars.</p>

<p>The most practical tandem harness, and the
most effective on all horses, with all carts, and in
all places, was suggested by, and in character is
similar to, the four-horse harness of mail and stage-coach
days, when everything useful and nothing
superfluous, was the rule. Some of its salient
features are its collars with angular or pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
throats, for preventing choking from pressure on
the windpipe; ringed hames-draughts&mdash;least
rigid, most yielding to shoulders, and most durable
ever designed, and like every two metal parts
working on each other (as leader's spring trace-hooks
and tandem eyes of wheeler's trace-buckles),
polished to avoid mutilation by friction; leader's
pad, or saddle, shaped to suit the back, however
sharp; strapping (as cruppers, loin-strap, etc.)
unlined and unstitched, in keeping with the broad,
stout traces of single thickness, of which the
wheeler's, furnished with chains at the ends, are
adaptable to the draughts, however long or short,
of all carts without moving the points of traces or
disfiguring them with three-cornered holes made
by a jack-knife. The harness above described,
while specially in keeping with the Whitechapel
cart, is very appropriate for the more showy,
highly painted dog-cart; as the more costly lined
and much-sewn harness is not out of place in both
these traps.</p>

<p>The chief objection, and almost the sole one, to
the harness of my choice, is its reasonable cost&mdash;none
whatever to its appearance or effect can
be offered, a set each of brown and black leather
costing, together, little more than the value of one
set of the other kind of harness.</p>

<p>The tandem of Mr. G. F. McCandless (Plate
XXXVI.), an honorary member of the New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
Tandem Club, will be remembered by those who
saw it in the competitions at the first horse show;
for effective association of colors of horses and
cart, as well as for other appointments, it stood at
that time unrivalled, whether seen on the road, in
the park, or on the tan-bark of Madison Square
Garden. The illustration is by Gray-Parker.
It is only a sketch, and in it there are defects
which did not exist in the original. For example,
Mr. McCandless's position on the box is too rigid
and straight; the wheeler is too far away from his
work. Nevertheless, the drawing is very smart.
This is a good example of the "going-to-cover"
cart described above. Mr. McCandless, whose
taste in such matters will not be questioned, has
in use the harness recommended in this article.</p>

<p>Inquiries are sometimes made as to the correctness
of using either the leader's loin-strap, or
wheeler's kicking-strap alone, that is, either without
the other. Both are practical appliances, and
either or both may be dispensed with, though the
loin-strap seems to be necessary for sustaining the
very considerable length of the lead traces; while
the kicking-strap, except for finish, is necessary
only when a kicker in the shafts is to be restrained.
A breeching for the wheeler, entirely useless on
the level, is indispensable for journeys through a
hilly country.</p>

<p>Views differ as to the length of lead traces. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
is admitted that to place a draught-horse as near
his work as possible is preferable, but it is claimed
that the rule does not apply to a tandem leader,
who works only on heavy or hilly ground, his
office being chiefly ornamental; indeed, as a friend
of mine used to say, the duty of the leader was to
deceive the wheeler, who would cheerfully do all
the work in tandem, when he seemed to understand
that he was being pulled along, though he
was dull in single harness.</p>

<p>A longish tandem is good in outline, and for
horses 15.3 hands I prefer lead traces 10 feet
to 10 feet 6 inches in length. Short traces, requiring
the leader at all times to be in his collar
to keep clear of the wheeler, are especially
adapted to the use of drivers whose leaders are
always at work up hill, down hill, and on level
ground; while longer ones are the sort for skilful
performers whose lead traces are gently swinging
when, on smooth roads, the cart seems to run of
itself.</p>

<p>Within a few years there has been invented a
contrivance for attaching lead traces to the
wheeler's harness by two bars, or "whiffletrees,"
of different lengths, suspended by a chain from
the wheeler's hames-chain. For the use of ladies
who drive tandem, or occasional experimental
drivers of the other sex, such safety arrangement
must be invaluable, but tandem drivers of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
school would hardly utilize such substitutes for
skill, or, to use an English slang term, they
"wouldn't be found dead with 'em," lest they be
denied a decent burial.</p>

<p>The driving seat, which is called "the box," is
made up of a hollow wooden box, with top sloping,
from the required height at the back, to its front
edge of, say, two or more inches in thickness, the
four sides being covered with the same material as
that of the cushion, which is scooped or hollowed
on its upper surface, sloped on its side edges, tufted
throughout its breadth and depth for firmness, and
should be fitted to the driver. For adapting it to
the use of all drivers, of whatever length of leg,
there is a cushion of no fixed dimensions; but it
is found that one comfortable for a man of, say,
5 feet 10 inches, and average weight, with a
correct seat and slightly bent knees and feet
drawn together, will suit nearly all, the shorter
man sitting a little forward and the taller one a
little back upon the cushion. A box-cushion so
thick in its front edge as to chafe the under side
of the legs of a driver with a good seat and feet
resting naturally against the sloping foot-board,
will cause much discomfort.</p>

<p>A score or more of years ago in England was
conceived the fad of plain, unshaped box-cushions
for coaches, so high at the back and with a pitch
so steep that the dragsman could not sit in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
could only lean against them, nearly this entire
weight being sustained by the foot-board; an
example of which may be seen in Barrand's picture
entitled, "The London Season," published
in 1870. This absurd fashion was short-lived.</p>

<p>If such a cushion is unsuited to a coach, it is
even more unfit for a two-wheeled cart, because
when the off-side wheel drops suddenly into a
hole, or strikes the ground after passing over a
considerable obstacle, the driver from his leaning
position, his legs being straight and rigid, is liable
to be shot out of his seat into the road, or deposited
on the wing over the wheel, from which
latter place a friend of mine informs me he was
often so fortunate, when using the objectionable
sort of cushion described, as to be able to scramble
back into his place without "pulling up."</p>

<p>Sitting in, not leaning against, a shaped cushion,
with body erect and knees slightly bent, and yielding
to the motion of the cart, the danger mentioned
will be materially lessened, and if forewarned
of a wheeler's falling, the driver may save himself
from being landed beyond the horse's head, even
if he fails to retain his seat in the cart.</p>

<p>It must have been to this conforming to the
movement of the vehicle on the importance of
which, as affecting safety, so much stress is laid,
that the celebrated Jack Mytton owed his preservation
when, running his gig-wheel up a bank, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
afforded his passenger a new sensation by pitching
him out like a sack of meal, and when, also,
as was his custom, he charged a gate with his
tandem, for he survived those and other similar
exploits. In my limited experience in driving tandems
I have never had a leader, however vicious,
part company with the wheeler and bolt with his
harness dangling about him; but if that event is
yet to occur, and the twenty-three feet of lead-reins
run clear, leaving my wheeler's bridle intact and
in place, I shall attribute such good fortune to
unbuckled hand-parts, and to the freedom of
action of the swivels in my wheel throat-latch, so
very practical, and so much to be preferred to the
fixtures attaching to the rosettes at the wheeler's
ears.</p>

<p>The whip, like every other appointment of the
tandem, is English, and is a very different affair
from the flail-like instrument used by our ancestors.
Of a tandem-whip, the stick should be 5
feet and the thong 12 feet 6 inches long. Some
authorities fix the length of the thong at 10 feet
or even less, to which, though seemingly impracticable,
certain tandem drivers conform involuntarily
by cutting off with their wheel a yard or so
of point and leaving it in the road. The convenient
disposal of this thong of such considerable
length severely tries the patience and
tests the skill of the beginner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>Holding the stick in the right hand at about
the upper mounting for balance, and the point of
the thong between the stick and the fingers, by a
dexterous motion, proceeding entirely from the
wrist, pitch the thong over to the right of, and
away from, the stick, which, being suddenly stopped,
the thong returns upon and is wound round it
about four times, producing the long, depending,
open loop, which is called the "double thong."
The coils are followed down the stick by a small
loop, and yet other coils of the point of the thong,
but in the opposite direction to the first ones.
Taking the small lower loop between the thumb
and forefinger of the rein-hand (which should in
no case be disturbed or diverted from its purpose
when driving), by a movement of the stick with
the right, disengage the point of the thong and
lay it along the stick to the hand. A turn or two
of the double thong round the stick to the right,
or off side, will effect the figure 8, which some
authorities condemn, but which is practical, as it
holds the thong on the stick when double thonging
a wheeler, or when driving in a high wind; and
many old coaching prints attest its correctness,
although it has often been suggested that the
methods of the men working a coach a hundred
miles a day, when coaching was a trade as well
as an art, have been improved upon since it became
a pastime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>The catching of two double thongs at the same
time, with as many whips held one in each hand,
is an altogether useless performance, and is
suggestive of the practice of legerdemain rather
than coaching. Men who drive, or who have
driven their own teams, would hardly devote their
time to such a purposeless occupation.</p>

<p>The thongs of new tandem whips are always
wiry, and it is difficult to make them hold to the
stick. The scheme recommended for making
them pliable is the following: loan your whip to
a persevering beginner and tell him, "Shut yourself
up in your room and learn to catch your whip
there and in private," as advised by the author of
"Down the Road."</p>

<p>If he really is ambitious, and has the necessary
application, and particularly if he persists in
following his own methods, by the time he has
acquired the simple little trick your thong will
have become quite supple; but if you are
likely to want your whip within a reasonable
time, you had better not concede to him the
privilege of keeping it until he has attained to
proficiency, as you may not get it back during
his natural life.</p>

<p>Beginners are much given to concerning themselves
about the cost and ornamentation of
their whips rather than the proper mode of
using them. A whip with extravagant mountings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
in unskilful hands renders its owner ridiculous.
The most important quality of any
whip is its feeling or balance, which is utterly
sacrificed to the silversmith when he is allowed
to affix to its butt a foot of his metal
of mediæval style. It is better to buy other
examples of his skill, and preserve your whip
in its original serviceable form.</p>

<p class="b1">The yew is the only whip of which I find
mention in old coaching days:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq20">"For, sure, the coachman hands are few,<br />
That wield in style the polished yew,"</p>

<p class="p1">and barring the fault peculiar to it of warping, the
yew is a capital stick. Holly is now in almost
universal use for whips of English style, and of all
whips and sticks is undoubtedly to be preferred.
Some thorns are also used, but it is rare to find
that sort of stick with the taper and feeling or
life of hollies, they being mostly of nearly uniform
substance from butt-end to point.</p>

<p>Since the publication of the coaching book,
entitled "Down the Road," in which is an illustration
of the dog-legged four-horse whip presented
to the author by the professional coachman, Tom
Hennessy, no dragsman's or tandem driver's
collection of whips is considered complete without
at least one whip with a single crook in the
stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>Driving aprons are important in the equipment
of a tandem, and should be in keeping with its
character. Bedford cords, box cloths, and other
materials of drab color are most durable, and for
sporting traps, most effective in appearance, and
their care involves comparatively little expenditure
of time and labor.</p>

<p>Aprons of plain dark colors furnish an agreeable
contrast to the driver's top-coat and the servant's
livery greatcoat when those garments are of drab;
but the work of keeping them clean is slavish, and
continual, and they quickly fade and lose their
freshness, on account of which objections to them,
drab ones, being free from the faults named, are
preferred.</p>

<p>A turnout, with a simple apron for the front
seat, and none for the shivering groom on the
hind seat, has an unfinished look, suggestive of
insufficient means or want of thoughtfulness for
the comfort of the servant.</p>

<p>Devotees of the art of tandem driving, who
have not enjoyed the treat of a perusal of that
charming book entitled "Frank Fairleigh," by
Mr. Smedley, may be entertained by the author's
description of the turnout of the Honorable
George Lawless, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perched high in mid-air, upon some mysterious
species of dog-cart, bearing a striking resemblance
to the box to a mail-coach, which had contrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
by some private theory of development of its own,
to dispense with its body, while it had enlarged
its wheels to an almost incredible circumference;
perched on top of this remarkable machine, and
enveloped in a white greatcoat undermined in
every direction by strange and unexpected pockets,
was none other than the Hon. George Lawless.</p>

<p>"The turnout was drawn by a pair of thoroughbreds,
driven tandem, which were now, their irascible
tempers being disturbed by delay, relieving
their feelings by executing a kind of hornpipe
upon their hind legs."</p>

<p>The top-coat recognized as the standard for
driving at the present day is called a "driving-cape,"
doubtless from its resemblance in the matter
of amplitude of skirts to a sleeved cape; and
when properly constructed as to its lines, balance,
and the position of its pockets is a very "down-the-road"
looking garment&mdash;a refinement of the
"Upper-Benjamin" of stage-coach days. Made
of stout cloth of drab color, not white; furnished
with a velvet collar which hangs off from the
neck to allow room inside it for a coaching
muffler with a bit of spot; the leather-lined
pockets, with flaps of liberal size, placed low in
the skirts for convenience of access; the outward
seams strapped and stoutly sewn, and lined with
an effective plaid of woollen, when hung at proper
balance on the shoulders, which sustain its whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
weight, and whence, in a downward direction, its
circumference increases until, at the bottom of
the skirts, which reach the knees, it stands out
from the wearer all around as if hooped inside,
it is very comfortable and of workmanlike appearance
whether worn or laid down on the box-cushion
of a coach or tandem cart.</p>

<p>Having described the properly appointed tandem,
we will suppose it has been brought round
to the door by the groom, who, having got down
and hung the reins on the wheeler's off-side terret,
or looped them through the corner of the dasher,
takes his place at the wheeler's head, where he
remains until his master picks up the ribbons,
when he goes to the head of the leader. Inserting
the middle finger of the right hand between
the wheeler's reins, and the forefinger between the
leader's, always keeping the near-side rein of each
on top, you have the near lead-rein over the forefinger,
the off lead and near wheel reins in the
order mentioned between the fore and middle
fingers, and the off wheel-rein between the
middle and second fingers. Having assorted
and placed the reins as directed, and adjusted
them as to length, still holding them together
with the whip in your right hand, laying hold
of the seat rail, with your left you climb into the
cart, and transferring your reins, without change
of their relations, to the corresponding fingers of
the left hand, you drop into your seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>Some carts, from their peculiar construction
and arrangement of seat, rail, and steps, not
being adapted to the pulling yourself up by the
rail with the left hand alone, as on a coach, it
may be necessary to take hold of the rail or the
corner of the dasher with the right, when care
should be taken not to disturb the wheeler with
the whip, which, with the reins, you have in that
hand.</p>

<p>Your passenger should have gotten up in the
box-seat at the same time as, or after, the driver,
but not before.</p>

<p>Having satisfied yourself that everything is
shipshape, gently feeling the horses' mouths by
their reins,&mdash;those of the leader, who should not
be in the collar at the start, should be a little less
slack than his traces,&mdash;you start your horses by
an "all right," or a "let 'em go," or a double click,
or by some other signal, but in no event using
the improper "pull up" in vogue, of meaning
directly opposed to your purpose.</p>

<p>Having seen the leader started, the servant, not
moving from his position, salutes his master as
the tandem passes, and when the tail of the cart
reaches him he climbs up, taking his place in the
middle of the hind seat and sitting quite erect
with folded arms, instead of slouching about "all
over the shop." A servant should have pride
enough to do his part in maintaining the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
of the turnout which he renders ridiculous
when sprawling in his seat and gaping about as
though waiting to recognize passing acquaintances.
He should look intently into space, and
affect to see nothing. A tandem is dependent
very much for its effect upon the groom, who
should be "all alive," and when he feels the pace
slackening, should concern himself as to the purpose,
and, getting to the ground quickly, find his
way to the leader's head by the time the team is
pulled up.</p>

<p>A dapper, trim-built groom, of light weight and
medium height, is most in keeping with the
character of a tandem, for which a very tall or
a very stout servant is unsuited.</p>

<p class="b1">When no passenger occupies it, the groom's
place is in the box-seat by the side of his master,
the tailboard of the cart being shut up. Lord
Tomnoddy's&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppq20">"Tiger Tim,<br />
Was clean of limb,<br />
His boots were polished, his jacket was trim!<br />
With a very smart tie in his smart cravat,<br />
And a smart cockade on the top of his hat;<br />
Tallest of boys, or shortest of men,<br />
He stood in his stockings just four feet ten!"</p>

<p class="p1">The equipage of the Honorable George Lawless,
whose cart and top-coat I have already described,
and whose taste in all matters appertaining to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
appointment of a tandem was unquestioned, "was
completed by a tiger so small, that, beyond a
vague sensation of top-boots, and a livery hat,
one's senses failed to realize him."</p>

<p>Rules for driving that have been made by the
proper authorities should be carefully observed.
Occasion may arise when it is necessary to take
liberties with prescribed forms. In tandem driving,
which should be done with one hand as
much as possible, there is one rule, the observance
of which is essential to safety, and that is
never to lose your horses' mouths by getting your
hands so close up to your chest that you have no
space to spare for pulling up. You may see some
drivers with their hands nearly up to their chins
and looking supremely happy in their ignorance
of the risk they incur. The proper position of
the left or rein hand is a few inches forward of
the body, with the elbow adown the side and
close to but not pressing against it. Nothing is
more awkward than the elbows at an angle showing
daylight between them and the body.</p>

<p>The draught on the reins from the elbows to
the horses' mouths should be as nearly as possible
on a straight line.</p>

<p>I would strongly advise beginners to avail
themselves of the instructions of any recognized
professional dragsman of whatever pretensions.
If you find one incompetent to teach you, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
are confirmed in your own skill, which is worth
all you have paid for the information. It would
be strange if any man who had practised the
calling for any considerable length of time had
not picked up some wrinkles or dodges worth
knowing that had escaped the learner hitherto.
An accomplished instructor having been found,
pupils should take a full course of lessons, as, however
apt scholars, they will hardly have absorbed
in a limited number all the knowledge acquired
by one who has devoted a lifetime to the pursuit.
Nearly all beginners are too anxious to exhibit
their self-reliance, and declare too early their independence
of the mentor.</p>

<p>Acquire the correct methods, or aim to do so,
of doing all things connected with tandem driving,
and be satisfied with nothing else; there can
be no compromise with what is called "form,"
a word, it may be remarked, so significant as to
admit of no qualifications; a thing is "form" or
is not "form," and the terms "good" and "bad"
prefixed to it are as superfluous as if applied to
perfection (compare p. 314). And when adopting
the customs peculiar to another country, one
should make sure he can reach an accepted
standard before attempting to improve upon it
or surpass it. Ambitious parties who always aim
to exceed recognized standards, essay to drive a
tandem of three or four horses, which they style<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
"trandom" and "random"&mdash;a straining after effect
in name as well as performance. As any number
of single horses, not less than two, harnessed in
a single line, are properly described as a tandem,
such aspirants for fame, having a name provided
for their turnout, may be concerned solely lest
they find themselves with too many horses and
too few hands for driving them. In my lexicons
of coaching and driving, no application of either
"trandom" or "random" is found, and, unless the
parties have a dictionary of their own, I do not
believe there is any authority for such use of the
words. A tandem of two horses, of which the
leader turns round and faces the cart, may be
said to be driven at random.</p>

<p>I wish, in closing, to express my obligation and
acknowledgment to Mr. Burton Mansfield, the
accepted authority in this country for many years
upon tandems and tandem driving, for the valuable
assistance he has given me in preparing this
article.</p>
